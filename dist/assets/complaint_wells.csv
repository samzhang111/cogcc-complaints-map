I have to have a fan on inside at night or I hear that constant popping sound. I have a tenant above my garage, and he can't sleep at night with the noise. BP has responded at least 3 different times over the past year when the noise is out of control, and they make it tolerable. However, they Band-Aid the problem and it continues to keep happening. Recently, the well has been running 24-7. A few weeks ago I complained about the noise, and per Miles at BP, a field supervisor went to inspect the well. She said the noise level was within compliance and again they ""Band-Aided"" the problem. The problem, and my biggest complaint, is this old cheap rusted exhaust system on the well. It constantly breaks and falls apart and becomes extremely loud. They go re-connect the same old rusted leaking pipe and cheap muffler system. This involves wrapping wire and tinfoil around it, which I'm surprised could be within compliance. I have offered several times to buy a new pipe and muffler myself, but BP doesn't seem interested. I've taken pics and videos of the system and they say as long as it's within ""compliance"" they won't do anything. I think a lot of my noise problem is seeping from the old rusted exhaust pipe that they continue to use. I know the system could be quiet and tolerable, and would stop breaking down if they just put a new pipe and ""acceptable"" muffler on the system. I would do if myself if I was allowed to. I'm tired of calling them and having them come out to bandage up the problem, when it could be fixed. This would be a huge relief for myself and my family as well as my tenant. I could lose my rental income because of the noise, and I'm afraid I'll have trouble selling the house because of the well. I think putting a new exhaust system on the well is a completely acceptable solution, especially when I've offered to pay for it, but BP continues to use the old rickety, rusty system. There is also a sound barrier wall on the wrong side of the well, I've asked several times if they can move the wall, but they snicker. There is nothing on the other side of the wall, and it actually amplifies the sound toward my house. The field guys just shove the end of the rusty old broken exhaust pipe under the wall, pointing away from my house. Last time I complained, the exhaust pipe was completely broken in half offering no noise relief, they just removed the broken piece and connected the same rusty pipe to the same cheap muffler. (the pipe eventually falls out of the old muffler and becomes extremely loud). BP said they ""ordered a new pipe"" which never happened. The metal housing on the old motor occasionally becomes loose and makes a ridiculous clanking and rattling sound as well.",,,,,,,,,,6707741.0,05-067-07741,67.0,La Plata,1,ANNALA FEDERAL A,C-001721,f,f,f,t,216135.0,326263.0,ANNALA FEDERAL GAS UNIT A-M34N8W 15NENW,PR,2007-09-26,10000.0,BP AMERICA PRODUCTION COMPANY,38300.0,IGNACIO BLANCO,6865.53,-107.73341,37.21966,257468.0,4122740.0,15.0,34N,8W,NENW,N,1013.0,N,2462.0,W,ACTUAL LatLong,f,f,f,f,t,f,f,f,,,,f,,f,http://cogcc.state.co.us/cogis/FacilityDetail.asp?facid=06707741&type=WELL,2017-02-24 11:00:00,2017-02-24 11:00:00,f

This involves wrapping wire and tinfoil around it, which I'm surprised could be within compliance. I have offered several times to buy a new pipe and muffler myself, but BP doesn't seem interested. I've taken pics and videos of the system and they say as long as it's within ""compliance"" they won't do anything. I think a lot of my noise problem is seeping from the old rusted exhaust pipe that they continue to use. I know the system could be quiet and tolerable, and would stop breaking down if they just put a new pipe and ""acceptable"" muffler on the system. I would do if myself if I was allowed to. I'm tired of calling them and having them come out to bandage up the problem, when it could be fixed. This would be a huge relief for myself and my family as well as my tenant. I could lose my rental income because of the noise, and I'm afraid I'll have trouble selling the house because of the well. I think putting a new exhaust system on the well is a completely acceptable solution, especially when I've offered to pay for it, but BP continues to use the old rickety, rusty system. There is also a sound barrier wall on the wrong side of the well, I've asked several times if they can move the wall, but they snicker. There is nothing on the other side of the wall, and it actually amplifies the sound toward my house. The field guys just shove the end of the rusty old broken exhaust pipe under the wall, pointing away from my house. Last time I complained, the exhaust pipe was completely broken in half offering no noise relief, they just removed the broken piece and connected the same rusty pipe to the same cheap muffler. (the pipe eventually falls out of the old muffler and becomes extremely loud). BP said they ""ordered a new pipe"" which never happened. The metal housing on the old motor occasionally becomes loose and makes a ridiculous clanking and rattling sound as well.",,,,,,,,,,6707741.0,05-067-07741,67.0,La Plata,1,ANNALA FEDERAL A,C-001721,f,f,f,t,216135.0,326263.0,ANNALA FEDERAL GAS UNIT A-M34N8W 15NENW,PR,2007-09-26,10000.0,BP AMERICA PRODUCTION COMPANY,38300.0,IGNACIO BLANCO,6865.53,-107.73341,37.21966,257468.0,4122740.0,15.0,34N,8W,NENW,N,1013.0,N,2462.0,W,ACTUAL LatLong,f,f,f,f,t,f,f,f,,,,f,,f,http://cogcc.state.co.us/cogis/FacilityDetail.asp?facid=06707741&type=WELL,2017-02-24 11:00:00,2017-02-24 11:00:00,f

Issue: There is a terribly noisy oil/gas extraction operation approximately 1/8 of a mile directly south of the southeastern edge of the Box Elder Creek neighborhood, located to the south and west of the city of Bennett. We have endured the pumps, wells, and fire spouts from Anadarko and ConocoPhillips for the past 2-3 years now. The noise of this particular location is deafening and seems to be getting louder. It starts in the evening at about 9pm and continues well into the night. My neighbors and I moved to the country to escape the noise of the city, and this constant evening noise is ruining our quality of life. Please let me know the process of ascertaining whether there is a way to diminish this noise annoyance. Is there a noise level parameter that these machines can operate?

About 15 minutes after calling Community Counts, Nita Smith called me back and said that she had called John Doose at URSA and he was sending a worker out to fix the problem.

Issue: During drilling, the use of an electric drilling rig reduced the noise level to manageable levels. However, since completions began, the persistent noise is unbearable; I can hear it over normal traffic on 71st Ave and can even hear it at all times of the day East on 65th Avenue. It was my understanding that Extraction was required to use electric frac crews due to the location being an urban area - traditional diesel engines are being used as evidenced by visible diesel exhaust fumes. Also, if Extraction cannot mitigate noise during completions, how are they going to keep the noise down during normal production? A location of that size is incredibly loud when you consider the combined noise levels from separators, LACT, VRUs, etc. This needs to be addressed and resolved immediately as there are a large number of homeowners in the area that are extremely unhappy with how the state and county continue to pander to Extraction for their Triple Creek project.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protocols for the CDPHE to test chemicals in the air is substandard and is not comprehensive in a manner that is objective science. I demand that the CDPHE stay on location surrounding the FOUR drilling rigs for one week to determine in multiple directions (including downstream of wind patterns) the volume and type of chemicals found in the air. 
I demand the industry cease and desist operations in neighborhoods. 
I demand the industry and the state pay for my medical bills.

After having the local fire department investigate they had found that the well has a severe ground leak of natural gas building up within the well pit. The domestic well was tested and found that no gas was coming from it. Therefore the leak must be coming up through the ground somewhere. The first incident started when I had heard a very large explosion that had shaken my house to its foundation. When I investigated I found the 50lb lid to my well pit had been blown about 25 feet off the well pit. After notifying the fire department I was told that it was a severe natural gas leak, and that it was in high enough concentration that the well pit was considered hazardous to human life. After a 2nd explosion from said well pit had occurred, it was evident that the problem is getting worse. When the 2nd explosion hit, the lid was blown roughly 40-50 feet in the air and landed on the roof of my house thus resulting in a damaged roof. I have also noticed that the water table has dropped a fair amount. I have contacted the fire department and even a county hazmat investigator named John Cole who had warned me to be extremely cautious around or inside the well pit. The levels of natural gas are considered hazardous and lethal.

Nature of complaint: Noise

Field Inspector Actions:
On 2-6-207, I was contacted by James Precup NE supervisor of the COGCC in reference to a noise complaint at the residence of the complainant Amy Hoffman 3620 Portofino Ave Evans co 80620.  

I attempted to contact the complainant on 2-6-2017 but was unable to contact at that time.

 I performed site inspections of the Evans pad located to the south of the complainants residence.  See inspection doc#672500387 for details of inspection. See attached sound studies from location.

LT Environmental, Inc. (LTE), completed a sound survey at the SRC Evans pad, as requested by Synergy Resources Corporation (Synergy), between February 13 and 15, 2017.  The survey was completed at a location approximately 350 feet north of the sound wall at the SRC Evans pad (Site), which is located in the southwest quarter of the northwest quarter and the southeast quarter of the northwest quarter of Section 26, Township 5 North, Range 66 West.  The land use just north of the Site is agricultural, with residences and livestock pens located approximately 0.3 miles northeast and northwest of the Site.  At the time of the sound surveys, fracing operations were taking place at the Site.
 
A 15-minute sound survey was completed on January 13, 2017, at a location 350 feet north of the north sound wall.  The 15-minute survey was completed using a hand-held Quest Technologies 2100 Sound Level Meter, and the survey was completed per Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGC) Rule 802 requirements.  Readings were collected every 30 seconds, alternating between A-scale and C-scale weighting.  In addition, a wind speed reading was recorded every 30 seconds as well.  The average A-scale readings for the survey was 51.42 decibels A-scale (dBA) with an average wind speed of 1.91 miles per hour (mph).  The average C-scale reading was 72.26 decibels C-scale (dBC) with an average wind speed of 2.25 mph.  Influence on the results due to wind speed is considered negligible, as all readings were below the 5 mph limit set in COGCC Rule 802.c.2. Although the C-scale readings were greater than 65 dBC, the location where the survey was conducted was not near a receptor.
 
A 24-hour A-scale sound survey was completed between January 13 and January 14, 2017.  The survey was completed using a data logging sound meter (a Noise Sentry RT manufactured by Convergence Instruments) weighted to the A-scale.  The data logger began logging at 10:50 am on January 13, and let run for just over 24 hours, until 11:55 am on January 14.  The data logger collected maximum,",2/17/2017,Y,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that the Oil and Gas companies are not forth coming, don't makie responsible, reasonable offers to home owners and just take what is not theirs. This is an issue that needs to be taken seriously! This shouldnt even be an option. Neighborrhood fracking continues to put people and the environment at risk when there are so many other options for access to oil and gas. Money and the bottom line should not be, the be all end all to everything. There are other places to Frack, I understand the need for oil and gas, but neighborhoon Fracking should not be an option when it is so close to society. The long term risk to health, the decrease in home values it will cause should negate anything else. Risk factors to people and the environment are well documented in all major papers, New York Times, Washington Post, etc. In recent years Oklahoma is the perfect example of what not to do. They have had a disregard for people and their property and the impacts of Fracking, its disgraceful! All the risk factors must be taken seriously across the country. Tax payers work hard to build a home for their family and now the requests from oil and gas and the cooperation that is taking place within this state jeopardizes all the hard work to build that and the surrounding community. It shouldnt even be an option! There is absolutely No reason to frack near homes, schools, hospitals or water ways! The risks of Fracking out way the monetary gain of a small oil and gas company, even the big oil and gas companies are abandoning Fracking because of the major risk factors and the legal ramifications that will occur in the future. You and our government should represent everyone in the state and not just special interest. The interests of tax payers and the community must become a priority. I hope you will build a stronger database on the implications of fracking and the real process involved. Also consider how you would want your own family to be safe in their home, school, hospital and environment. How would you feel if the value of your hard work and your life was washed away, your loved ones lives and home not take seriously by corporate greed! I hope everyone will come to an agreement on neighborhood fracking and see what a risky option this is to everyone and the major ramifications it will have in the long run.

Nature of complaint: Noise

Field Inspector Actions:
 On 5/7/2015 at approx. 1330 hrs, I was contacted by my Supervisor Jim Precup in reference to a odor complaint in Fort Lupton.  Upon arriving at the KPK battery, I contacted the KPK  pumper Corey Kreutzer who was at the location.  He indicated the compressor at the location had went down with high line pressure the night before.  I asked him if he had witnessed any release of gas upon his arrival and he indicated he did not. I performed a complete inspection of the facility and found stained soil by the compressor which was documented in my inspection report along with corrective action to deal with the stained soil.  As part of this inspection, I verified that the five ECDs were working properly and that the pilot light was on for all five ECDs.  During this inspection, I did not notice any odors coming from the location.  I spoke with the complainant Mr. Towes, he indicated he and his wife had recorded approx 13 hours of the release from the night before. Mr. Toews showed me approx a 1 to 2 minute video on his wifes phone of a release coming from the pressure relief valves on the tanks at the battery.  This video was recorded around the time the pumper indicated the compressor had went down due to high line pressure.  I advised the complaint I would complete my report and forward it on to CDPHE for further investigation.",5/7/2015,Y,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They installed a low water crossing for their heavy equipment to get in out, which they do not keep cleared, But indicate we should use it.

1] Landowners have spend up to 5+ hours clearing this site to pass out of canyon

2] The blockages are caused by bad weather, bad design & a oil company installed pipeline crossing creek. This pipeline ditch was back filled, but the rain came along, washed fill into creek, and changed course of creek, causing damage to bridge banks No clean up by company for 5 years we have asked for. 

3] The depth of the fill has been 5 foot plus, landowners took over 5 hours to dig thru debris, with gas employees watching. Landowners have repeatedly had to clear this area to get out. There is no way out .The bridge & this portion of road has been dropped off their maintenance; [which is NOT to road standards] all together. We just had an occasion where one of the canyon residents needed hospice care, family had to get large 4 wheel drive to get thru this low water crossing, because the nurses could not take a normal car thru 14 + inches of mud & rock. Many landowners use this bridge, it is not great, but it is what we have; now they seem to be trying to block us from using the legal road. This located pass first bridge next to their concrete low water crossing. Today there is 12 inches of water in low water crossing from rain, bad maintenance because the dirt was not cleared so water could flow away.

Issue: This strong, concerning smell occurred starting May 20 and noted on May 24 (those are the dates that I recorded), but it has been present many other days following, including into the month of June. We notice it mostly during the daytime hours and most days of the week now. Starting May 20, 2017 there was a strong odor outside of our home that was described as natural gas or some sort of chemical. To our knowledge there was no gas leak in the neighborhood according to Xcel. This smell was so strong that potential buyers that were seeing our home (Our house is on the market) were concerned about the odor! On May 24, 2017 we had our back sliding door open and the entire house filled with a chemical smell (similar to turpentine) so much so we had to close all of our windows and doors because the smell was so strong outside! It was very concerning because we let our children play outside and we are runners - but our activities now depend on the chemical/petroleum smell outside.

Issue: Odor, Color Change, Deposits: My wife and I bought the property located at 8482 Cr 47 1/2 4 years ago. at that time the water was fine. Appox. 2 years ago a fracing well and lift station was erected to the South of us. There were a few issues with the water turning tea colored with particles in it, but it clear up in a day. Now that there are 4 new wells to the North within the last two months, the well water has gone to a brown color with a large amount of rust colored and black sand-like particles. I cannot help but think that drilling a gas-oil well several 1000 feet through the water supply located at about 650 feet hasn't disturbed the quality of water. The water problem isn't going away. 

Well age is unknown, pump was replaced in 2012. Well use is Household Use, Livestock/irrigation.

COMO, LLC granted Kerr-McGee Gathering LLC a pipeline easement on March 9, 2015 with the limitation appearing on the first page that the pipelines constructed were to be  two three-inch pipelines.  I have a habit when dealing with Kerr-McGee or Anadarko that all the pages of any document be initialed for fear that documents could be altered. I never do this with any other operator- just Anadarko/Kerr-McGee because of my past history with their less than honest  tactics. I have attached a copy of the original grant for your reference and review.
            In December of 2016, I was contacted by Kerr-McGee requesting an amendment to the Righty-of-Way Grant to allow for four inch lines, when I discovered that the original Right of Way granted by COMO, LLC was altered to eliminate the restriction of the two three-inch pipelines, the elimination  of the initials at the bottom of the page and the different handwriting on the date. A copy of the altered document is also attached for your reference and review.
            This amounts to fraudulent conduct. Perhaps with your enforcement and penalty powers you can get Kerr-McGee to understand the seriousness of their behavior. My client and I have refused to meet with them to discuss this matter as in my opinion it would be a total waste of time. From the beginning Kerr-McGee referred to  the altered Right of Way Agreement as a Duplicative Easement.  I have a string of e-mails referencing the Duplicative Easement.
It is not a duplicative easement- it is a fraudulent document.
            Kerr-McGee states that this is not what they are about. This is clearly what they are about this example of deceptive behavior is just the exclamation point when describing their business practices. I have some many landowner and mineral owners that would be glad to express their disdain when dealing with Anadarko. I will not accept any more cases that involve Anadarko/Kerr-McGee since the playing field is not level. Anadarko has no idea what it means to negotiate in good faith.
            This is being sent to the Commission with the hope of stopping this type of behavior that permeates Anadarkos practices and makes them accountable. Even if no action is taken, we have the satisfaction of making a record so the Commission can verify by the attached documents, which speak for themselves, what the landowners are up against.  Thank you.

Issue: This is regarding a large and likely unreported oil spill event on an existing oil and gas property near Denver. Tudex Petroleum is the owner/operator of this property.  On the property is a building containing a manifold which connects several well flow lines to stage tanks on the site. At some time in the past, a very large spill occurred inside the building highlighted on the accompanying Google Earth screen capture.

The oil spilled was not recovered.  The operator simply hauled in loads of dirt or gravel to sop up the oil to the point where a person could walk around inside the building.  So a large volume of oil remains. As you know, over time the various toxic heavy elements in the oil will seep downward into the water level, or in the event of components heavier than water, will continue to work their way downward through the water table/aquifers. Tudex has several wells in the area, as well as other production facilities.  All appear to be in a poor state of repair.

This matter should be investigated before the operator attempts to further conceal it or sells it to unsuspecting buyers. Further, due to ongoing residential development very nearby, the local residents deserve some measure of protection from the potential pollution likely to be emanating from this dilapidated facility.",COGCC inspected location 10/18/16.  Specifically inspected the manifold building where alleged spill had taken place. There were areas of historic accumulations of oil stained gravel and soil as well as several leaking valves.  Operator was given corrective actions to properly remove or dispose oily waste and repair and maintain valves & fittings to prevent leaks.  Inspector hand dug in several areas inside the building to determine if a former spill had been covered up.  Soil underlying the gravel in the building appeared clean.

which she believed was coming from the well located to the west of her home.
I performed a site inspection at the State 5-36 and I also performed a sound survey approx 25
from the residence of the complaints home. See Inspection Doc# 685500990 for results of sound
survey and site inspection results.

indicated by the complainant. According the lease operator the unit on location only runs from
07:00 to approx 16:00 hrs.

Complaint: 1. Traffic: Those of us who live close to this site are concerned about the amount of large truck traffic that will be created on Cherry Avenue. This is a main access road to the school and there are often children walking to school during the school year, families walking with children in the evenings and days when school is not in session, parents driving children to school, school buses, horses being ridden and driven in training, people walking their dogs, etc. This is part of what makes this a nice neighborhood area and people feel safe, even though Cherry has no sidewalks, as it is just outside the city limits. 2. Noise, Air Quality/Odor, Dust, Pollution, Lighting: We are also concerned about our property values going down with so many wells so close to our homes. For 2 years there will be a great deal of noise, odor (we have just learned that they will be using oil base drilling fluid), and pollution. This pollution will be a danger to young, developing lungs and to those of us who must live with it 24/7. The high power lights are on all night and will make it difficult for those of us near this facility to sleep at night. 3. Size: The size of this project is rediculous in this area, 24 wells, 18 oil tanks, 2 water tanks, 24 separators, 2 meter houses, 4 vapor recovery units, 8 emission control devices and 2 vapor recovery towers on 6 acres in an R-1 zones residential neighborhood. 4. Notification: The notification they sent of a neighborhood meeting was only sent to those who lived within 500' of the wells, and the school was not notified until school was out for the summer, so NO parents of Bella Romero students received notification of this monstrous project. Extraction Oil and Gas has not been honest with us. They stated it was too expensive to apply for a driveway exit onto Highway 34 Business (east 18th Street) but that they were waiting to hear back from CDOT if they could use that exit point. When I spoke to Gloria at CDOT she said they had communicated with her by email but had not yet submitted an application for a drive exit onto 34 Business, the cost of which is $100. They also stated that they had shareholders in the ditch that were willing to lease them water and that they have CBT (Colorado Big Thompson) water they could run in the ditch so that they would not need to truck in water. After consulting with one of our more experienced Directors on the Greeley Irrigation Company ditch board, of which I am also a Director, he said ""GIC shareholders cannot lease them their GIC shares, not legally decreed for that use. Nobody can deliver foreign waters such as CBT in the ditch either without an agreement from the GIC Board either"". So far, they have not presented any requests to the Board.

I said I thought it was coming from that oil rig. Then, two nights ago, we had neighbors over for dinner and dominoes out on our patio and the noise, once again, was extremely loud. It was around 5:00 and we live about a mile from the rig. The neighbors both said they hear it all the time and how awful it is. We have other drilling going on around us, but, I have never heard this type of noise. Why is it so loud and when is it going to stop?",See complaint closure letter describing COGCC response to complaint,7/5/2017,Y,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nature of complaint: Odor

Field Inspector Actions:

On 6-30-2017, I was contacted by complaint specialist Megan Adamczyk in reference to several complaints received by the COGCC about odor occurring in the Fort Lupton area west of the Kerr McGee, Greens drilling pad.

 On 6-30-2017, I performed a complete site inspection of the Greens location and the neighborhoods west and north of the drilling pad. At the time of inspection, I observed Precision drilling rig 461 on the location performing drilling operation for Kerr McGee.  I reviewed location records, which did not show any abnormal drilling conditions at the time of the complaints. As part of my inspection I performed a sweep of the area of the complaints in an attempt to locate any odors off location. At no time during this inspection did I detect any odors off location. At the time of the inspection winds relatively calm with slight wind out of the west.

I spoke with Stan Walters of Kerr McGee and he indicated that had received a complaint and began using an odor mitigation product at the beginning of the week.

 
All information reviewed and site inspection information were submitted to the complaint specialist for further review.

It sounds like a passing train (that never ends) or maybe a super-highway that has been relocated right outside our window. Speaking of windows, we can't open ours at night anymore--which means we are hot...and cranky...and losing sleep. THIS IS NOT RIGHT. I vow to keep complaining, even though COGCC obviously doesn't care about the HUGE nuisance this well site is creating. This morning, it might have even been the loudest yet.

Field Inspector Actions:

On 6-29-2017, I was contacted by James Precup NE supervisor of the COGCC in reference to a noise complaint of smoke and odors coming from and ECD at the Westwind location in Windsor

I performed a complete site inspection of the location and I did not observe any smoke coming from any of the ECD or separators at the Westwind location at the time of the inspection.  I took a photo of the separators and the ECDs on location and attached this to the inspection report.  I spoke to Extraction staff on location who indicated the facility had an upset condition due to line pressure on 6-28-2017 which caused an ECD to burn improperly for a short period of time.  Extraction operators made adjustments to the ECD to resolve the upset condition. No odors were detected off location at the time of the inspection.

 All information reviewed and site inspection information were submitted to the complaint specialist for further review.

Address:  7303 18th Street, Greeley, CO  
			
Nature of complaint (sound, noise, etc): Traffic Pattern Violation

Complainant contacted via phone at approximately 2:30 PM and discussed the situation.

Inspection details: 

Visited and submitted inspection of the location at 2:00 PM on 6/16/17.  Truck traffic was evident leaving location at the time of inspection; however there was not enough volume to cause the backing up of traffic at the location exit at the time of the inspection.  Backhoe and front-end loader were active removing material from location.

Construction and traffic on 71st street exacerbates the problem by extending the time required for trucks to leave the location.

Spoke with security contractor at entrance to location concerning the complaint. 

Spoke with operator personnel concerning the complaint, and they will follow-up with further communications with completions supervisors.

Drilling operations have been concluded and completions wellheads were being installed.  No high capacity water tanks on location at time of inspection.

We see the upper half of the drilling rig. Pervasive creosote type smell, so strong you can't even be outside on the back patio. Nor are we able to have windows open as the smell is then in the house. This is happening easily 5 times a week at various and multiple times a day. Worst is of an evening. On average, 5 days a week we are smelling a strong odor much like creosote used to treat/preserve wood. The smell is so pervasive that even with just our windows open the smell wafts into the house. If we have our back porch slider open it is significantly worse. At this time we are very limited as to when we can have any door or window open When the smell is present it is so strong we are forced in to the house and unable to spend anytime on the back patio. This happens any where from morning to midday and most evenings. This is recent with in the last 30 days.

Nature of complaint: Noise

Field Inspector Actions:

On  6-6-2017, I was contacted by complaint specialist Megan Adamczyk in reference to several complaints received by the COGCC about noise occurring  at the residence of the complainant.

 On 6-9-2017, I performed a complete site inspection of the Anadarko Garfield location located the east of the complainants home. I reviewed location records, which did not show any abnormal fracking conditions at the time of the complaints. I also contacted Anadarko and requested they have a third party perform a sound study at the residence of the complainants home.

 I contacted the complainant and he indicated he would prefer a third party sound study performed rather than the COGCC 1 hour sound study as he indicated the noise occurred more at night and he would prefer the study to be over a weekend so he could be present when the study was performed.  

The third party sound study results were reviewed on June 16, 2017 and did not indicate any violations of COGCC rules.

All information reviewed and site inspection information were submitted to the complaint specialist for further review.


No violations of COGCC rules were observed at the time of the inspection.",6/16/2017,N,N,,N,,N,,12342629.0,05-123-42629,123.0,Weld,35C-35HZ,JAGUAR FED,,f,f,f,t,444432.0,444427.0,JAGUAR 36C-35HZ,DG,2016-11-14,47120.0,KERR MCGEE OIL & GAS ONSHORE LP,90750.0,WATTENBERG,4993.32,-104.86096599999999,40.03024,511863.0,4431120.0,23.0,1N,67W,SESW,6,320.0,S,1766.0,W,PLANNED LatLong,t,t,f,f,f,t,f,f,,,,f,,f,http://cogcc.state.co.us/cogis/FacilityDetail.asp?facid=12342629&type=WELL,2017-02-24 11:00:00,2017-02-24 11:00:00,f

Main Street, Florence, CO 81226. The caller's complaint was that the crematory was smoking, so I informed her to contact the EPA. 

I now have a completely different question.  The crematory that is being operated there has had little to no maintenance that I am aware of for a number of years.  This crematory is also sitting on-- and run by-- a natural gas well.  The piping for that gas line seems to be uncovered, rusty and appears to be running along the side of a ditch.  This property was just sold to its new owner, Lloyd Harwood.   From what I understand, the previous owners of the property installed the crematory without prior approval through city government and possibly state government, as well.

I was under the impression that when a property with a crematory changes ownership, the crematory would need to be changed into the new owner's name. When I contacted your office, I was told that the crematory was still under the names of the previous owners, one of whom is now deceased and the other has just been convicted of murder.

With this crematory sitting on a natural gas well in the middle of downtown Florence, Colorado--  a residential area--  I respectfully request that this facility be inspected for the safety of the residents and the community.","On (5/16/17) at 10:00 am I met with Brian Allen(General Manager) and Beth Holt-Madone(Owner) of the Holt Family Funeral Home.

The inspection request would be addressed, but I let them know that I and my previous supervisor had inspected this well 12 times between (8/25/09) and (1/27/17).  I told them I would inspect the well while I was in Florence.  I let them know I had started looking for leaks yesterday and I would finish my inspection after this meeting.

""The well in question (API 007-06049) was drilled in 1979 and completed in the Mesaverde in 1981.  The MVRD is actually a group of formations, but back in the day we allowed operators to use that formation code.

Both homes are no longer hooked up to well.    Well has not been P&A'd (see photos) and is in the front yard of 5545 Juhls Dr.  Homeowners asked that I ""sniff"" for methane in the crawlspace of both homes.  I used RKI GX-2003 4-gas meter (CH4, CO, O2, and H2S).  I had no readings at either property.  I was unable to access the furnace at 5545 Juhls Dr and suggested that the property owner contact Excel (gas provider) to see if they would do an inspection to confirm that the former domestic tap line had been unhooked (as he believed had been done when the property was ""hooked up"" to supplied gas [1950's - 1960's ?]).  I also inspected the furnace at 5501 Jay road and confirmed that the former domestic tap (2-inch line) has been unhooked and capped.   

Diana Burn (Engineering) present and discussed possible plugging operations and timing with the landowners. 

Based on this inspection COGCC staff do not believe that this well presents any hazards to property or homeowners.

The 10"" line that carries in excess of 1 million gallons of fuels per day including diesel and jet fuel to the Denver area starts at Highway 34 east of I25 heading south through my 150 acre development Rolling Hills North ?through Johnstown as close as 36' to houses with basements and perimeter drains that existed when the 10"" was installed in 2007. It continues south through developed areas in Firestone and Frederick to Henderson. The old 6"" line installed in 1963 remains approximately 12' away from the newer 10"" line and is I think filled with Nitrogen an inert gas and unused. My litigation through the Supreme Court that I won which you can look up Larson v Sinclair  forced them to remove approximately 3000' of the 6"" line on my development where they capped both ends and left the old 6"" line buried and unused everywhere for the remaining 38 miles or so to Henderson. There are two old Anadarko lines near the STC 10"" line in my development the closest being within a few feet. These old wells are attached to gathering lines leading to old tank battery sites. I have asked Anardarko repeatedly to P&A the four 
?wells because of the proximity to Johnstown and the STC lines and for safety for my development plans including a school site and approximately 400 homes. Children and people walking dogs are frequently walking on my land near the old wells because a walkway over the STC lines ends at my land near the SW well. I hope the Anadarko commitment to shut in all verticle wells includes those on my land.  However, there are many  other operators  and different companies facilities along the location of the two lines for the 38 miles.

Inspection details:

Complete drilling inspection was conducted on the morning of 5/5/2017 by Craig Carlile and Conor Pesicka photos are included in attachment.
BOP charts were reviewed, permit examined in rig dog house.
Location exhibited multiple sound BMP including: power from electric grid, surrounding 40ft sound walls, equipment specific sound walls within location, sound wall on location by complainants residence and earth sound absorption berm 15 feet above grad and hay bales (Photos attached to inspection document 674005174).  Discussion was held with driller and company representative concerning safety plan and operation/training of TWI valve and wrench location on drilling floor.

Chemical storage utilized curtained metal container. Liquid chemicals were stored with a variety of secondary containment devices.

Fully enclosed flare was installed.  Drilling has been conducted in an overweight mud fashion to minimizing gas combustion.

Rig was nearing TD on the well and anticipated moving to a new well at same location within a few hours.

A sound survey was attempted but the field inspectors were not able to isolate the sound to the drilling operation.  Complicating factors included a chain saw in operation to the north of the location and normal noise with 71st street traffic.  Rig noise was not audible at location near the property line between the drilling location and complainants residence.  It may be possible to better isolate the noise attributable to the drilling operation with a survey conducted in the early morning hours.

Issue: We are disturbed by the broken promises and the ongoing noise. When we were first contacted about the horizontal drill to begin in August 2014, were told by Ryan Kaminky of Bayswater, that it would be a 3 month drill and they would be putting up sound walls to minimize the noise. They did not go high enough with the sound-wall citing soil softness issues and the drilling went on for a good 6 months longer than they projected. We did not complain then, knowing that there are unforeseen problems in any business and it would all be temporary. At the completion of the drilling, they said they would build a dirt berm that would be line-of-sight higher than the semi truck engines on both the north and east sides. They also put up a metal sound wall around the compressors which they have now taken down on one side. They put up a metal wall to reflect sound away from the neighbor to their south, but it is not a sound wall and only serves to bounce the noise back up to us. When they stopped building the dirt berm much lower than promised, we thought they would be continuing with dirt they hauled in. However, when we came home from Thanksgiving Dinner 2015 and saw them putting grass seeding blankets on the mound wek new we had been lied to and immediately called Ryan Kaminky who came out and did sound readings. A few days later on December 3, 2015, they solved the noise problem by putting up a couple of rows of big (rotten) straw bales. It did not look good, but it helped the sound tremendously. Since then, though, they have removed the bales, taken down the north sound wall on the small compressors and it keeps getting noisier. Between the compressor noise, the siphon pumps, the diesel truck engine noise and the occasional high pitched whistle, noise is constant and disruptive to being able to enjoying life out in our yard in the day, or trying to sleep at night with the windows open or closed! We believe we have been immensely patient and given them every opportunity to fulfill their promise and be good neighbors. We are now going the next step to complain to you. We have pictures and sound recordings from the last few years, if you are interested in them. We hope you can help us. This year we are celebrating the 100 year anniversary of Barry's Grandpa buying the farm we are still farming here and we are planning a Johnson family reunion this summer. It is so disappointing to have to cope with the ugly view, but the noise is the worst and very hard to ignore. It is so sad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Issue: We had received royalty payments from Bayswater for the past years. They sold our wells to Exploration, and they are using a different accounting system.

I would like to be directed to an individual that is knowledgeable with accounting procedures to review the information included with the monthly payments. They are so much different than either Bayswater or our earlier one, Matrix Energy.

I sent a letter to Exploration and received an e-mail from Rachel Edison. The information was not complete and I replied with additional questions. The second reply was received by Miroslav Karljevk. That person did not address our concerns, but stated that, ""The reverse rebooks are done to update all the owners on a well with the most correct information we have. This sometimes means you will gain value and other times have a net loss on these prior periods. Reverse rebooks are a constantly on going thing and we always try to have the most correct payments/data on hand."" She added, ""The causes for reverse rebooks/adjustments can be due to a lot of different things, such as there being an incorrect price at the processing facility, a difference in interest you may have in the well, misallocation on the system side, etc."" I requested a followup, but have not received a reply. There are a total of seven families receiving royalty payments off this facility. I estimate that a total of $5,000 or more are being withheld due to the accounting that Exploration is using on our lease.

On 4-3-2017, I was contacted by James Precup NE supervisor of the COGCC in reference to a complaint at the residence of the complainant Brad Oconnel 10463 WCR 6 Fort Lupton Colorado.  

I contacted the complainant he indicated the noise was coming from the drilling rig located to the east of his home, he said there was a loud air horn being used at the location at all times which was disturbing. He also said he was smelling strong diesel odors coming from the drilling rig as well.

I performed a complete site inspection of the location on 4-3-2017.  At the time of inspection, as I approached the location off of WCR 6 I detected odors which appeared to be coming from the rig. I reviewed location records, which did not show any abnormal drilling conditions at the time of the complaint. All lighting on the rig were pointed down and toward the center of the location at the time of the inspection.

I spoke with the Kerr Mcgee company man at the location he indicated the horn used was a safety horn, which he would make, sure was only tested twice a day during reasonable daylight hours.  He also said they would check the masking agent used to mitigate the drill cuttings odors and attempt to adjust them to reduce the odors coming from the rig.

They also burn off flammables that come out of the ground while they drill. We are also breathing the fumes from the engines that are used to drill. The fumes that result from the drilling process are unbearable causing head aches and other problems. There are days that it is so bad we don't want to go outside to take care of animals or work in the yard. The fumes also make their way into the house, we have a well sealed house but the fumes are so concentrated they still come inside. I feel that the fumes are at an unhealthy level and need to be stopped immediately until a third party monitors what the fumes are and checks them 24 hours a day to ensure we are living in a safe environment.

Field Inspector Actions:

On 4-3-2017, I was contacted by James Precup NE supervisor of the COGCC in reference to a complaint at the residence of the complainant Brad Oconnel 10463 WCR 6 Fort Lupton Colorado.  

I contacted the complainant he indicated the noise was coming from the drilling rig located to the east of his home, he said there was a loud air horn being used at the location at all times which was disturbing. He also said he was smelling strong diesel odors coming from the drilling rig as well.

I performed a complete site inspection of the location on 4-3-2017.  At the time of inspection, as I approached the location off of WCR 6 I detected odors which appeared to be coming from the rig. I reviewed location records, which did not show any abnormal drilling conditions at the time of the complaint. All lighting on the rig were pointed down and toward the center of the location at the time of the inspection.

I spoke with the Kerr Mcgee company man at the location he indicated the horn used was a safety horn, which he would make, sure was only tested twice a day during reasonable daylight hours.  He also said they would check the masking agent used to mitigate the drill cuttings odors and attempt to adjust them to reduce the odors coming from the rig.

Due to the odors smelled of location this complaint was forwarded to the CDPHE for further review.

All information reviewed and site inspection information were submitted to the complaint specialist for further review.

It is in an area South of County Road 74, West of Highway 257, East of County Road 15 and North of County Road 72. Within that block of land there are two large operations going on. (Another point of reference is the Valley View Ranch subdivision. It is just west of that subdivision.)
Issue: I am complaining about the night time noise. There is constant activity all night long at these operations. Even 2, 3 and 4 in the morning there are annoying sounds. The sounds can be described as humming, high pressure and vibration sounds. This has been going on for many weeks. We thought it was just a temporary situation for a few nights, but we were wrong. Our family members have been woken up in the middle of the night on many, many occasions and had difficulty getting back to sleep with the annoying noises emanating from the operations. It is significant because our home sits about two miles away from the operations, and our bedrooms were built with extra sound boards to deaden outside sounds. Our windows are covered with both double cloth blinds and heavy curtains. One of our family members has used ear plugs, but still the sound wakes her at night. Our family dog does not like sleeping in our son's room any more because he is annoyed by the humming sounds. The sound issues are ridiculous and a chronic problem for our family. The operations should either quadruple their sound insulation or shut down all activities that cause humming and vibration sounds at night.The noise occurs frequently, and in daytime too. However, daytime operations blend in with the normal daytime noises. Our complaint is about the night time operations. When it is totally quiet everywhere at might, we here this loud humming and vibration sounds coming from the operations and waking us. I put that it started in January, but not sure about the exact start date. It has been going on for many weeks though.

Noise is described as humming, high pressure and vibration sounds, intermittent, currently ongoing, beginning on 1/1/2017.","Complaint #:	200441252

I performed a site inspection at the locations indicated by the complainant. See inspection doc# 672500480/672500479 for results of site inspections.

 I contacted Extractions Josh Carlilsle to get the sound study results from the times the complaint had experienced the noise to check for any possible compliance issues. All information from the studies and the site inspection were directed to the complaint specialist for further review.

 At the time of inspection, no violations of COGCC rules were observed.

The facility in question is in the center of Sweetgrass surrounded by houses and directly adjacent to a playground.
Issue: I spent nearly a decade working in the O&G industry, so I am fully aware of setbacks and current regulations. My main concern is related to the production facility that is located directly adjacent to a playground that was recently installed. It is frustrating that developers do not have to abide by the same setbacks. O&G companies could never drill a new well and production facility this close to a playground, but the developer can build a playground within a stones throw of tanks, separators, VOC burners, and various other industrial equipment. I have witnessed with my own eyes a person catch a face full of gas coming from a leaky tank faint and fall down a flight of stairs. I have also been told stories of oil transport drivers breathing in a face full of gas when a thief hatch is open and killing the driver, when he passed and and hung himself by his sweatshirt on the catwalk of the tank battery. How in the world can we ensure that the small children playing at that playground are safe, and will not be exposed to gas leaks and chemical leaks, soil contamination e.c.t. What kinds of assurances do we have that a truck driver won't come to pick up an oil load mid-day, open a thief hatch and expose the entire playground to fumes and chemicals. This is a frightening proposition. I understand the implications of moving playgrounds or production equipment, so I am asking for a a review of the SOP for this facility and possibly a full inspection, including FLIR cameras to ensure no leaks.","Based on complainant's concerns, the COGCC Field Inspection Supervisor for the area has upgraded the location to place it on the inspection list for this year, but in the absence of any indications of a current issue, can not prioritize the location for an immediate inspection.

Nature of complaint: Noise

Field Inspector Actions:

On 3-17-207, I was contacted by James Precup NE supervisor of the COGCC in reference to a noise complaint at the residence of the complainant Brian Kearns 10623 E. 163rd ct Brighton CO 80602.

I contacted the complainant who indicated he had a drilling rig to the NW of his home, which he could hear at nighttime for the past 2 nights.  The complainant indicated he had driven past the Great Western Marcus Pad and he noticed the site did not have sound walls as it did before when drilling operation were on location last year.

I performed a complete site inspection of the location and I observed the site did not have drilling walls up on the south end of location.  In review of the COA for the Marcus Pad COAs proposed Based on Sundry Form 4 doc no 400800848 and meets COA requirements regarding sound Form 4 Sundry doc no 400795097 - GWOG did a preconstruction reconnaissance visit with construction, operations and regulatory personnel to delineate pad location, layout, access, and an site specific mitigations that would be prudent.  Based on this visit it was determined that sound mitigation efforts would be focused along the southern edge of the location and that no baseline noise survey was likely necessary.  GWOG will install a 554-foot long, 32-foot high, fabric sound wall on the south edge of the pad for noise mitigation in the direction of a single residence to the south approximately 800 feet from the pad.  There are additional residences farther south and southeast of the pad.  In addition, exhaust ports for engines on location will be directed away from the nearby residences to the south.  See inspection doc for further information and photos.

 I contacted GWOG personnel and advised them of the COA and the noise complaint which the COGCC had received.  GWOG indicated they would be setting up temporary walls until they could place the walls described in the COA BMP.

All information reviewed and site inspection information were submitted to the complaint specialist for further review.",3/17/2017,Y,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today, at 1:10 pm, the same thing happened as I described in complaint document 200441186 dated March 8, 2017. What appears to be the same model of three tanker trucks pulled out of the site separated by approximately 50 meters on the access road and again pulled up in relatively close order adjacent to Ms Stein's house. Although the actual intersection is obscured from my view, I was able to get my camera in time to capture a partial view of the last truck waiting in line. I have sent this picture directly to Field Inspector Gomez for his use in determining the operator of the trucks. The three trucks are large enough that there is no way that they are servicing the two Noble tanks adjacent to the Extraction site. They came from the Extraction Triple Creek site. So far as I am aware, the COGCC complaint site is the highest appeal level available to me, so I am forwarding this to our attorneys as well as Mr. Garrott and Mr. Mueller with the City of Greeley Planning Department in hopes that they can suggest a next step. Regarding the sound wall, Mr. Gomez and I had a very pleasant conversation with Ms Stein on March 8, just after he had visited the Triple Creek site. We discussed the 32' tall sound wall and Ms Stein requested that the top 16' be removed from the first (eastern-most) two 32' tall sections and that all 32' of the wall be pulled from the remaining western wall. This should enable trucks to more easily detect other trucks lined up to exit the site and avoid more violations of BMP 13, Traffic Control. Mr Gomez was unaware as to why the wall was in place other than for Ms Stein's well-being, but after speaking with her concerning her anger at never having been contacted, her claustrophobia and loss of mountain views, he said that he would pursue having those sections removed. We hope to hear from him or an Extraction representative soon.","Complaint #:	200441200

Issue: At 12:35 this afternoon, I saw three tanker trucks leaving the site in a row. They pulled up one after the other until all were able to exit the site. This process took about 2-3 minutes and during most of that time, a truck was idling next to Dawn Stein's bedroom window. This is not supposed to happen. Trucks are supposed to temporarily park back around the corner or at the pad, waiting for exiting trucks to leave the access road according to BMP 13, Traffic Control. The problem is that the 32' tall sound wall does not permit exiting trucks to see how many trucks are waiting to exit in front of them. The solution is to remove the 32' tall sound wall or at least the top 16 feet. It's very existence is a puzzle to all of us. Extraction has told us that they are doing it out of consideration for Dawn, but it only gives her a claustrophobic sense every time she sees it. It also completely blocks her view of the mountains to the west. Unless there is some reason of significance regarding safety or sound, we can see no reason why it should not be removed. And now you have a violation of BMP 13 as further indication that the wall is not only a personal hindrance to Ms Stein, but also a cause of a BMP violation. Furthermore, I can find no reference to the use of a sound wall, either 16' or 32' around Ms Stein's home. Instead, there is a requirement for 8' tall hay bales and Jersey barriers, according to BMP 30, Construction. It would appear that the sound walls are there in lieu of the bales and barriers, which is understandable. However, in view of the problems associated with the sound walls along the west side of Ms Stein's property, we ask that they be removed. Please ask that Jason Gomez contact me for more information.","Complaint #:	200441186

Upon inspection of the location I observed other dirt work being performed north  and south of the Pratt pad on WCR 5 this work was being performed by utility crew not related to the Pratt pad. 
 
No violations of COGCC rules were observed at the time of inspection.

I was recently a part of the town hall phone call Crestone held with residents 1/2 mile from the Pratt and Waste Management drill sites in Erie, CO on 2/15/17 at 6pm- open to residents of within 1/2 mile of the sites. This was a new format for them in place of a public face to face meeting which they acknowledged, along with acknowledging they would assess the call afterward to see how the format went. The format did not work and was very frustrating and not informative. We were given directions should we want to submit a question and directions did not work, or when they did work were horribly untimely (waiting 20+ minutes to get to ask a question to an operator who then screened to see which questions would be asked). There were periods of long silence while we were told our questions were being screened by operators and several moments when the Crestone representatives verbally discussed that there were no more questions or only a few left to be asked (even though there were several still in the cue). We were aware of this because not only did the operators say this but several people were communicating via social media- along with the call. I myself had several in the cue. On the online portion of the presentation there was an option to ask questions that they were able to see however about halfway through the call we were told they would answer those questions at a later time (even though we had long periods of silence). There was not an opportunity to respond to answers as well. This was not an effective format and a new meeting needs to be organized to make sure residents have the necessary information going further",Notified the complainant that COGCC does not specify the format of public meetings.,2/23/2017,Y,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All questions were screened by an operator and most were not answered as asked by residents or not answered at all. One of my many concerns was the setback distance from homes. We asked several times for the setback distance, they avoided the question and to date, the question has never answered, even though I sent them a follow up email. Often with their answers, they referred back to Encana. Which is not satisfactory, Encana was a disaster from the start and had many violations. They say they want to be ""good"" neighbors but have demonstrated from their conference call, that it is not there intention at all. I would like to know what is the setback from homes to their site and I want to make sure that they will be in compliance. Also, what is the time frame for them to send out notifications to residents. We have received ONLY ONE letter from them and it was regarding the phone conference, a week before the conference.

Noble Energy began fracking on the section adjacent to ours. We live on Weld County Rd 20 (28667 WCR20, Keensburg). Approx. a week after the fracking took place, we noticed some cracks taking place in our father's garage - a large crack that looked like it had been cleaned out- the cement had blown out on the edges of the crack. All the concrete expansion joints were blown clean of dirt, grease and debris, cracking in the walls as well. His building was put up in the early 60s and had just minor hairline cracks until this incident. Now there are cracks large enough to stick your finger in. 
At our house we had the same thing happen - our barn with cement floor had large cracks in it, our shop and warehouse with cement floors had large cracks and some of the cement had even moved, lifting the floor up or down. (none of this was present before fracking) We had no new noticeable cracks in our house, it was built in 1926. So it was hard to tell which cracks were new or old. 
We are not anti-gas& oil or against fracking. We know fracking shouldn't impact surfaces like this, but in our case did. 
We have had 3 different contractors look at these cracks and we were told they have never seen anything like this before. Noble Energy also looked it over, they also claimed they had never seen anything like it either. Noble was going to hire a 3rd party to assess the damages, but we haven't heard back from them yet.",Complainant was informed that issues relating to property damage are civil in nature and COGCC has no jurisdiction over civil issues.

A meeting has been set by Crestone however several residents on the surrounding streets still have not been notified of the meeting- to include myself and my property backs to the Pratt site. Our notification has come word of mouth by neighbors who did receive the letter. Also, when operations previously ended at that site due to the unresolved issues, the residents and Erie BOT were told a face to face meeting would be sheduled when operations resumed. The reputed scheduled meeting by Crestone is being done over the phone as they are claiming not enough people came to a meeting they previously hosted in Erie- but many residents in that area are saying they were never made aware via proper notification that the meeting was taking place. This is again a lack of notification issue.","COGCC staff contacted Crestone Director of Environmental, Community, and Regulatory Affairs Jason Oates. Mr. Oates reported that notice was sent to the complainant's residence, but since they had not received it, he contacted them to provide information for the call-in meeting. COGCC staff explained to the complainant that the plans for an in-person meeting were made by the previous operator and the Erie BOT, but were not included in the COAs or BMPs for the location, so COGCC can not require the operator to host an in-person meeting.

I contacted the complaint who indicated she been hearing loud vibration noise coming from the Orr State Synergy pad for approx. 2 weeks. 

 I performed a complete site inspections of the Orr State pad located to the north of the complainants residence.  See inspection Doc#672500416 for details of inspection.  I was unable to perform a sound study at the residence as the complaint indicated she was moving and she would not be available.

I contacted Synergy Resources to obtain possible third party sound results for any sound studies they had competed at the location. David Pennington indicated he would forward that information to the COGCC.

We have started to experience shuddering of the house during nighttime hours. It woke me shortly after 5 AM this morning. We are experiencing it now, again, after 8 PM. We are home during the day and have not noticed it during daylight hours. The intensity varies intermittently and reaches peaks every few minutes, during which it significantly rattles dishes in the cupboards, items on shelves and pictures hung on the walls. It is audible from the home framing and can be felt through the floors of the main level (but not the basement slab). I have a sound recording of the dishes rattling during one of the intensity peaks. I initially suspected the heat pump but it is persisting with the home HVAC system turned completely off. We have experienced all kinds of winds without the house shuddering.

I have spoke with Terry from HRM and basically the response was the well wouldn't produce without the pumpjack, and indicated it was producing. But if it is producing then why are there no production numbers or surface owner payments? I spoke with Jill at COGCC over a week ago and she indicated she would reach out to HRM and have them contact me, but I have heard nothing back so I figured I would submit a formal complaint.

When I purchased this property there was just a small gas pipe coming out of the ground with a small fence around it. About a year after purchase, without notification the oil company came in and fracked the well and installed a large pump jack on the property. The well head sits right in line with where the houses should be built causing prospective buyers to walk away from the property and commenting on the location of the pump jack as the reason. I have asked about going back to the small wellhead, and have been told no. It is frustrating that a large pumpjack can be placed on the property in line with where houses should be built, decreasing the surface value. There has been next to nothing paid out in surface owner pmts since the addition of the pump jack so I can't even use that to offset for potential buyers. It is frustrating that oil companies can come in and profit with no regard of how it devalues our land.","COGCC Hearings Office Jill Dorancy contacted the complainant and informed her that the issued described in her complaint are governed by a surface lease agreement, over which the COGCC has no jurisdiction.

Field Inspector Actions:
On 1-17-207, I was contacted by James Precup NE supervisor of the COGCC in reference to a noise complaint at the residence of the complainant Sawn Aschliman 294 Fieldstone Drive Windsor CO 80550.  

I contacted the complainant and she indicated she had been experiencing noise coming from the Extraction Winder south location.  The complainant stated the noise occurred during the nighttime and it was very loud like a helicopter.

 I performed site inspections at the two active locations west of the complaints home the Westwind location and the River Bluffs locations.  At the time of inspection, I observed  the Westwind location was in the process of transitioning from a frac operation to a flow back operation, the equipment at the Westwind location were not actively in use at the time of the inspection.  See inspection Doc#672500321 for details of inspection.

I also performed a site inspection at the River Bluffs location in an attempt to find the source of the possible complaint.  See inspection Doc#672500324 for results of site inspection.
  
At the time of inspections, I did not find any issues or possible causes for the noise sources. No violations of COGCC rules were found at the time of the inspection, which could be related to the complaint.",1/17/2017,Y,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We (our neighbors and I) do know that fracking is getting ready to be started, if it already hasn't started. My house shook until a little after 8:00 this morning and there was a very loud noise. It should be acknowledged by the COGCC that these complaints have been filed before during the first round of drilling and tracking. We have discovered that our houses have begun to show cracks that have never been noticed before. I know that if/when my property ever goes up for sale, we will have to disclose all of these problems.

Field Inspector Actions:
On 12-7-2016, I was contacted by Jim Precup supervisor for the NE Inspection unit in reference to a noise complaint at the residence of the complainant Eileen Rojas 1358 Washburn St Erie Colorado.  

The complaint indicated she was awoken from her sleep by a loud noise on 12-7-2016 at approx. 2100 Hrs she said the noise remained loud for approx. 30 minutes and then subsided. The complainant indicated the loud noise was not occurring now and that the noise was very sporadic.

I was unable to perform a sound study on 12-7-2016 due to high wind and cold weather conditions. 

I contacted Crestone drilling supervisor Robert Samples and he indicated he would pull his sound data to see if anything had occurred.  I also performed a full site inspection at the Woolley-Sosa-Becky location. See inspection doc# 672500233 for inspection results.

Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (the COGCC) regarding a failure by Kerr-
McGee Oil & Gas Onshore LP (KMG) to provide a timely response to Miracles written
request that KMG explain a large number of deductions for downward adjustments to past
royalty payments.
In a letter to KMG dated August 4, 2016 (attached hereto as Exhibit A, together with the
spreadsheets referenced in Exhibit A also attached hereto as Exhibit B and Exhibit C), whichletter was mailed to KMG via Certified Mail, Miracle requested answers from KMG regarding substantial payment deductions from previously-paid royalties related to 17 oil and gas wells.
The return receipt for the Certified Mail indicates the letter to KMG was signed for by James Felder on behalf of KMG on August 9, 2016. In the said letter, Miracle advised KMG that its letter was pursuant to Section 34-60-118.5(2.5), C.R.S., and that KMG had sixty days to provide a written explanation to Miracle for the deductions described in the Exhibit A letter.
On September 15, 2016, Ken Morrison from Anadarko (KMG) left a phone message for Daniel Jones, counsel for Miracle who sent the Exhibit A letter to KMG, indicating that the letter had made it to his desk and he would be working on a response to the same. Since that time, there has been no further communication from KMG and Miracle has not received any written explanation from KMG for the deductions exceeding $300,000 for which Miracle requested an explanation.
As of the date of this Complaint, now more than 90 days after KMG received Miracles letter requesting an explanation for the substantial deductions, KMG has failed to provide the written explanation for the deductions as required by Section 34-60-118.5(2.5). The deductions referenced in the Exhibit A letter relate to the following seventeen (17) oil and gas wells:

Issue: It was brought to my attention October 26th, 2016 that permits to extract oil and gas from the Breniman wells have been reinstated in the last week and allow for a start date of November 1st 2016. These permits will extract minerals under my property of which my wife and I are 50% rights owners. As a rights owner I am entitled to decide when and if minerals are extracted from my property. Further, if a future decision is made to extract minerals from my property an established lease on rights is required prior to extraction. It is with disappointment that I find the State of Colorado, including Weld County and the Colorado Oil and Gas Commission has made no effort to contact and inform me of the extraction of minerals in my ownership. Extraction Oil and Gas did contact me and did invite me to a community meeting tonight. They mentioned a previous public comment period, however that forum as documented was for complaints surrounding noise, air quality, injecting carcinogens into the ground, etc. No communication related to oil and gas extraction proceeding without lease in place was made known to mineral owners in Grasslands Subdivision in Windsor Colorado. I am requesting the permit be pulled until it can be guaranteed that mineral owners without signed leases are guaranteed minerals on their land and under their ownership will not be extracted. With current permit in place those guarantees cannot be made by Extraction Oil and Gas as confirmed at the community meeting on October 26th. Minerals will be extracted from my property unless action is taken which I am expecting from COGCC prior to November 1st, 2016. If there are concerns with pulling the lease for reasons stated above I would expect the Colorado Oil and Gas Commission or other local or state agency to hold a community meeting similar to Extraction Oil and Gas company's October 26th meeting in which the rights of mineral owners and options going forward can be explained in detail.

Good afternoon Andrew,

Be advised that we are aware of the balance owed to McAfee, and intend to pay it eventually as we manage our cash flows through the industry slowdown. If McAfee wishes to incur additional legal or collection costs, that is their prerogative, but it will neither hasten nor further ensure payment. I would appreciate it if you could advise your client of this; feel free to forward my e-mail. If you and they wish to further discuss or pursue legal avenues, I can direct you to one of our in-house counsel.

Issue: Magpie production wants to dredge water pit to build up banks so they can keep well producing. Pit is very full and i do not want the contaminated soil and water gettining into the farm ground. The well did not run all winter and spring so they could have done work then but wait until pit is full then want to make a mess. I also feel i should be compensated for compaction of the farm ground by the equipment working in there. In the past the coggc has made them haul in pruduct to build up banks and i would much rather see that done. The well produces very little oil and much water. They have an excavator on location and plan to do this tommorow.

BBC has worked to renew the lease, or execute a new lease with Mr. Lake, but has been unsuccessful.
 
BBC does not believe Mr. Lakes concerns with respect to notice are material for the following reasons: (1) Mr. Lake was not required to be noticed when BBC filed its application; (2) Mr. Lake, who has executive rights on behalf of several other parties, was given actual notice of the application on behalf of those parties (e.g. the Allen B.

Nature of complaint: Noise/Odor

Field Inspector Actions:
On 10-3-2016 at approx 1400 Hrs I was contacted by COGCC staff in reference to a noise/odor complaint in the area of Evans CO. I attempted to contact the complainant by phone but did not make initial contact. I was later contacted by phone by the complaint Aaron Davidson who indicated he was experiencing a low frequency vibration coming from the drilling rigs which were located to the SW of his home.  The complaint also indicated he was experiencing a strong odor coming from the drilling rigs as well. 
On 10-4-2016 I performed a site inspection and a noise survey at the rear of the complainants home see inspection Doc# 673803744 for results of inspection and results of noise survey.  During my inspection of the drilling locations I observed approx 32 sound walls on the north, south and east side of the location used for sound mitigation.

Sound survey was run approx 25 of the complainants home in the rear of the residence toward the source of the noise approx GPS of 40.37512 -104.73444. Results of the survey indicated an Leq 1 level of  56 dB (+/- 3 dB)  and a Leq 2 low frequency level of 66.9 dB (+/- 3 dB) indicating a possible compliance sound issues at the Evans Drilling locations.   During the sound survey I observed traffic on both 37th street and 35th Ave. At the time of the inspection and during the sound survey I did not detect any unusual or strong odors at the rear of the complaints residence. 

I spoke with Synergy both Company men (Steven Wilson and Sean Devereaux) on location and they indicated no change had been made in their drilling operation which could have caused the noise or the odors. Both drilling rigs submitted copies of their mud reports for the last 4 days showing no changes in the mud used in the drilling operation. See inspection Doc# 673803744 for attached mud reports.  David Pennington of Synergy Resource contacted me and indicated Synergy would be setting up a third party sound study at the complaints home to assure compliance of COGCC rules.

Our adjacent neighbor was approached by Trent Sizemore of Lonewolf Energy Inc. for plans to drill for oil. The plans were not shared to me from Lonewolf Energy Inc. despite the close proximity which would greatly affect our health needs, aesthetics, future business plans, quality of life, as well as resale value of our property. Instead I learned of the plans through our neighbor whose site the proposed drilling would occur. The plans were designed without any respect to our concerns, nor were they ever communicated to my family from Lonewolf Energy Inc. This is highly unprofessional behavior to not seek out all of the neighboring residents of a proposed drilling site in order to find the most appropriate solution for a drilling site with public health, safety, and welfare in mind. My wife has health concerns directly affected by noise, pollution, and extreme lighting, all of which would be factors exasperating her condition and it is for this reason we moved out here. There are other locations further away on our neighbors property that would not be in extreme close proximity to us, but the regard to which this would affect our quality of life is of no concern.

Today I was on the XTO website and when I saw a certain picture of [individuals] that was the straw that broke the camels back. I have been upset with XTO for quite some time. No more than a few month ago I hit up [XTO] to replace a gate to the well on my property. [XTO] explained to me even though the gate was in piss poor shape we would have to live with for he time being because gas prices are so low. 

So here I am living with this shotty gate and [individual] not only gets two new gates but they are automatic gates and a fancy entrance. Then he is getting a new fence buil. And the thing that really chaps my ass is the situation with the gas taps. Over the last few years my gas tap and all my neighbors I know of with wells on their places have lost gas taps and forced on propane in the name of safety. I speak for myself an all my neighbors that the old gas taps are surely missed and much more useful to us than this ---- propane. During this same time [individual] doesn't get put on propane but actually gets two more new gas taps from XTO!!!

Why do I know all this stuff. God love him but [individual] loves to brag! He is pretty proud to have a company man in his back pocket. XTO employee and his wife lives in a house provided by [individual] that gets free gas from a XTO well. 

So my question to you fellows is why does [individual] get all this stuff done for his place and we can't get simple repairs done? I can't afford to give a place for a company man to live and buy him a side by side to play around on and my neighbors can't either. For the longest time I thought we were dealing with a weasel but when I saw a picture of that weasel with [individual] standing in his dads hay field made me wonder if XTO knows how this guy operates and thats just how you do all your dealings. 

Here is your chance to make it right with the rest of the tiffany folks. I'm not putting my name on this cause I don't want a company man to keep blowing smoke up our ass and do nothing. The lip service ain't gonna work on us any more. Maybe I need to call J Paul Brown and the Durango Herald if we don't see some things changing pretty ---- quick.","COGCC staff reviewed the complaint and determined issues regarding property improvements provided by an operator are civil issues, over which COGCC has no jurisdiction. COGCC could not intervene to improve gates unless there is a safety issue, which is not alleged in the complaint. 

Regarding gas taps, COGCC has determined a tap is provided by an agreement between the operator and the recipient. COGCC has no official rules to apply and we would have no authority to require that it be re-established, especially if there was any indication that it could not be done with the utmost safety.",9/30/2016,N,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Issue: For the first time since building our home in 2004, the oil companies had large thumping machines in our area around Sept-Oct 2015. Although we did not allow them on our property, they were on all the properties around us. There are also several wells in our area within 1/4-1/2 mile of our well. We built our house in 2004. The water well has been tested every two years and water was excellent and did not need a water softener. October 2105, our water turned orange with extremely high levels of iron. We had to have a company install a commercial water softener, UV light and a filtration unit. It is odd that for all the years prior our water was excellent and within two of months of the thumping trucks in our area, the water turned bad. I would like to have someone come out and test the water to see if in fact it was caused by the oil company.

The State Wells were spud in 2103 and consistently produced through May 2016. Schell has received royalty revenue from the State Wells. Upon information and belief, Encana in in the process of transferring ownership and/ or operation of the State Wells to Crestone Peak Resources Operating LLC. 

In June 2016 Kerr-McGee (KMG) fracked the McKinstry 28N-21HZ well (123-37009), with surface location in T 3N, R 68W, 6th PM, Section 22: NE/4 and bottom hole location in T 3N, R 68W, 6th PM, Section 21: NE/4, approximately 225' south of the State 3H-16H well lateral (per COGCC map). Both wells are drilled in the Niobrara formation. 

In August, Encana attempted to turn the State Wells back ""on"" (after turning them ""off"" for KMG's McKinstry drilling operations). The State Wells could not be turned back ""on"" due to KMG's drilling operations. Schell spoke with a pumper from Encana on-site at the State wells who admitted to the following: 1. KMG's frac of the McKinstry well severely clogged the state 3H-16H and 3G-16H wells. 2. Encana has no intention to workover the state 3H-16H and 3G-16H wells to bring them back into production. 3. The other State Wells filled with water, requiring Encana to pump excessive amounts of water out of them. 

KMG failed to 1. Conduct an anti-collision review prior to drilling, pursuant to its APD. 2. Protect against interference with the existing State Wells. 3. Report is drilling operations error to the COGCC. 

As of July 2016 all of the state wells have been designated as shut in. Schell has not received royalty payment from the State wells since May 2016. 

Schell's mineral interests are under lease with Extraction Oil and Gas LLC (Extraction). Schell has made Extraction aware of this issue. Allyson Vistica of Extraction indicated she would call Encana. No follow-up has been received by Schell.

Operators routinely err in their drilling operations, causing issues with surrounding wells. Rarely, if ever, are such errors reported, despite the ill-effects on other parties' correlative rights, the creation of waste, and the resulting inefficient and improper drainage. Schell is personally interested in ensuring that (a) his minerals are not improperly drained or caused to waste and (b) his royalty interest maintains the value it held prior to KMG's drilling error. In addition, Schell is publicly interested in ensuring that such common place drilling operations errors cease, so as to ensure the protection of other landowners; rights and Colorado's natural resources.",COGCC Engineering Supervisor Diana Burn reviewed the wells listed in the complaint and determined there are no apparent violations.

The shallow water table is isolated from the injection zones by over 8,000 feet of rock, including over 5,000 feet of shale which is a low permeability rock that inhibits the movement of water.  The flowlines that connect the injection wells to the pump have passed recent integrity tests indicating that the injection piping is not a source of water causing the increase in the water table.  There is no evidence to substantiate a link between the shallow water table in the area and the operation of the injection wells.  

The amount of water necessary to raise the regional ground water table is likely attributed to the increase in rainfall in the years 2014, 2015 and early 2016 prior to the drying trend that started in August 2016.  The rainfall accumulates in low areas near seasonally wet playas, and as that water percolates into the subsurface, the water table rises.  If the recent shift toward dry conditions continues, you may eventually see the water table decrease and the size of the playas shrink.

There is no evidence that oil and gas activity or underground injection activity in the area has caused the water table to increase.  Therefore, COGCC has closed your complaint #200440358 with this letter.",11/22/2016,Y,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Breneman (went to Mrs. Larrick former Mrs. Breneman) deed that shows that they sold the farmland in the early 1960's but did not sell the mineral rights.  Now the former Mrs. Breneman's trust (The Larrick Trust) has half of our mineral rights in it and they do not own it and they also are being paid on a lease on our mineral rights.  

Also Rex Monohan who was a producer in the 1990's that paid my elderly parents is now showing what appears to be my parents mineral rights and is being paid on them and there is another wild deed on our mineral rights with a lease.  We are requesting a full investigation on this as taking money from the elderly and disabled is a crime in both Colorado and Missouri.  

There was a probate in Missouri and the wills were filed.  My brother Ron was informed by two different trust attorneys that my parents had that he was not in my parents for over 19 years.  He was in the CM Roark trust that my dad personally distributed that Trust to him and my nephew Collin in 2008.  If Ron wanted to contest it, there was time in 2012 for him to protest it but he did not.  That time has passed.  He was informed.  There were no grandchildren in the trust.  There are no per stirpes at all.  My will went to my kids but no grand kids.  Ron and I were to take care of our own kids in our own wills.

I initially thought this was a family matter but it is not, these are other people who have actual deeds on our mineral rights that have not paid my parents or myself to purchase my parents or my mineral rights and no one else had the power to do that.  My brother Ron only had a power of attorney over non producing mineral rights and the power of attorney specifically mentioned the land he had power of attorney over.  He and I both did not have a power of attorney ever over my parents Adena mineral rights so we could not do a sale before my parents died and my parents never sold it.  So, if a sale occurred before their deaths, it was elder abuse.  I did not sell it and neither did my parents.  My parents placed it into their trust in 2010 or 2011 and they did not sell it so we have a fraud if someone sold it.

Please open an investigation immediately.  

Plus the new division order of 320 acres is on a horizontal well that my trust never got paid on from 2012 on.  It was shut down in October of 2015 even before we signed the division order.  That is unreal.  We believe it was to reduce our division order on Section 7 1 North, 57 West in order for these other parties to be paid on our ownership.","Complainant contacted by COGCC hearing officer Jill Dorancy and provided the following information regarding COGCC's lack of jurisdiction over the issues in the complaint: The COGCC can assist you in collecting money from the allocation of production from your minerals.  However, our jurisdiction is very limited.  Section 34-60-118.5 gives the Commission jurisdiction to calculate the amount of proceeds due? to? a payee and to enforce the timely payment of those proceeds.  But we do not sort through whether a party is entitled to the money. It leaves to the courts the authority to decide contractual disputes, such as a whether a potential payee is legally entitled to proceeds ?as a result of any deed or other contract issues?. The Commission reserves? ?the determination of contractual disputes ?for the? state? courts in? order to? ensure? the proper and consistent resolution of complex legal questions?.?

From my review of your email and documents, it appears that there are questions over the ownership of the minerals. Unfortunately, we cannot investigate why there is an issue or what the issue is.  In order to establish ownership of the minerals, you must go to District and/or Probate Court.  If you believe there is fraud involved,  you may also contact the appropriate county and find out whether there is a hotline relating to elder abuse.

Once the ownership is established, then you can come back and we can help resolve the payment of those proceeds.",9/21/2016,Y,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I finally went to bed at midnight so Im not sure how long it persisted after that. 

The noise (a motor/ generator rumble) was constant, accompanied by intense vibrations that rattled cupboard dishes and could even be felt in the ground surrounding the house, to the street and beyond. 

Not only do I resent the invasive, mysterious disturbance; there is reason to be concerned about the effect of such prolonged shaking of my home, two wells, and various gas/ utility connections. 

Such intrusion is presumptuous and unacceptable. It vividly illustrates the reckless abandon with which heavy industry permits are issued. In this case in the midst of a 50 year old established residential neighborhood.

Site inspection was performed in conjunction with a walkthrough with Austin Anderson, operations superintendent.  Additional inspectors present were Jim Precup, Chris Binschus, and Aaron Trujillo.
Walkthrough yielded presence of diffuse knapweed on all sites.  Unused equipment, including equipment on the Sooner 2-28 was addressed.  Anderson verbally assured that equipment on the Sooner would be removed next week (week ending 09/02/16) with unused equipment on the Krager battery and wellsite to follow in the 2 weeks after.

The property is located at: NWNW of Section 3, Township 1 North, Range 68 West of the Sixth 26 Principal Meridian, County of Weld, Town of Erie, and as described as Parcel #146703000004 in the Weld 27 County Assessors records and known as the 33 acres at the southeast corner of Hwy 52 and WCR 7 My father and mother purchased our piece of land on December 6th, 1971 for the sole purpose of investing in my families future for our retirements of either my mother Pauline or their son myself (Gary Cavalier). In the summer of 1976 Nachelle and I moved to Delta Colorado and began our life together. We have now lived here on the western slope of Colorado since that time and were only over to the Denver and Weld County area a hand full of times over the years and always came by our property to see that everything was alright there. It was hard to tell what had been going on there over all the years. On November 3rd, 1976 my family entered into a surface owners agreement (with at that time Champlin Petroleum Company) with the thought in mind that this would help offset the payments being made to buy the property from Phillip and Rita Edler who were the property owners we were in the process of buying the land from. The Surface Owners Agreement was written to show that we would receive 2 ˝ percent of all the oil removed from our property and of all oil commingled through our property in holding tanks. In turn we would grant permission for them to place on the property a proposed well to be drilled and a pumper to be placed there. It was written to give them rights to retrieve their oil (of which they were the mineral owners) in exchange for the 2 ˝ percent received. In the summer of 1983 my father Emil Cavalier passed away and the property was left to my mother Pauline and me Gary. My father never seen the day that the property was paid off and completely owned by our family. On May 7th, 1987 the property was paid off and a release of deed of trust was recorded and the property was now ours. On April 3rd 1992 we signed and recorded an updated Surface Owners Agreement, with at this time Union Pacific Resources to update our records. It was the exact same Surface Owners Agreement we had entered in with Champlin Petroleum Company in December of 1976. This was to reflect the fact that my father had passed away and my mothers health was not good and the property had been placed in my name by deed. My mother passed away in December of 1993 and at that time she was financially set and the property was not sold for her retirement and was passed down to myself for my retirement and for our families financial future. We spent several years attempting to sell our land by owner. Property sales at that time were not doing well and although we had some interest in the property it was not selling.

On June 4, 2016 we received a letter and lease proposal for the Breniman 11 well, in Windsor, CO, from Extraction Oil & Gas.

Notice of Proposed Wellbore Spacing Unit) prior to the submission of the Form 2 to the COGCC for approval in 2014. It appears, since we did not get the required notice, that Extraction Oil & Gas misrepresented this fact to the COGCC, who, based on Extraction's certification that all mineral owners in the spacing unit had been properly notified and no objections were received, gave their approval to the Form 2 and administrative approval of the spacing unit.

Our Community, Sierra Club, Boulder County and Legislators have communicated numerous times with Mr. Lepore, the COGCC staff including Ms. Trietz, Mr. Notto, the Commissioners and others, including entering many unresponded to comments into the application itself, about the negative impacts that these applications exhibit: the lack adequate mitigations for this area and Boulder County, lack of responding to concerns and all unanswered question from the comments on the application, and concerns that the COGCC rules don't' protect our community, landscapes and environment from this magnitude of Industrialization in our rural neighborhood. By approving these 12 wells and 2A, the COGCC has approved the 'takings' of our right to a quality of life that we chose, our property values, and our health. There wasn't adequate (or any) proof from the COGCC that these wells would be 100% safe for us, for the entire time they would be in existence therefore by approving and permitting these 12 well permits and their associated Industrial Complex Facility Site, the COGCC intentionally and knowingly has put our community and our environment at high risk for dangerous explosions, leaks, fires, VOC emmissions, methane emmissions, excessive truck traffic that blocks our egress and ingress and as our community repeatedly stated these concerns and requested that these well and facility site permits not be approved by the COGCC.Our community is not willing to accept these risks that the COGCC thinks are okay and by approving these 13 permits, has put our community, our way of life and our environment at high and dangerous risk. The 13 permits associated with this location should be withdrawn from the approved permit list until all questions, concerns and have been completely and fully addressed and that the COGCC is able to put, in writing to each community members satisfaction, that we would be 100% safe, that our property values will remain 100% intact, that Rd. 18 and County Road 1 and Oxford Road will remain completely 100% safe and always 100% usable as our ingress and egress - with each community member satisfied that they are well taken care of, that there will never be a VOC emmission blowing in our window or diesel fuel coming in our windows or on our farms, an explosion, a fire related to these 12 wells, or any kind of spilll - in all of these ways we need 100% proof and assurance BEFORE these 12 permits are approved.

To collect the rebate he marked an estimate paid. He should file this theft on his 2015 year-end returns, return this money and pay for this crime. I have submitted this to the Colorado General Attorney and the FBI.

[Anon] thought she was a partner, but he excluded her on partnership filings with the state and the EIN. In the brief time Green Acres was in business (2015) and they billed four invoices and made $26,536.89. Furney stole approximately $22,000 of it out of the safe and [anon] immediately quit and I froze the QB account. I hope he files this on his year-end returns.
 
None-the-less, Black Hills Corporation selected Applied Energy Group's (AEG) for the central management of their Colorado, Wyoming, Iowa and S. Dakota efficiency and demand reduction program portfolios (rebate processing). AEG paid Furney without validating his purchase. This money came from electric rate payers and should get returned. I tried to tell AEG and Black Hills to go after Furney, but we are unaware of any action to date. I have all the documents to prove this. Furney owns land in Pueblo and Green Acres was a grow facility located on his land. I discovered the false rebate when Furney's girlfriend entered the rebate money in QuickBooks Online. I questioned her repeatedly and found out.
 
One other thing I would like to mention is Jay Furney owns Double J Construction. He paid Green Acres Emporiums employees from Double J Construction. To me this was wrong and I questioned this.

Complaint: On the afternoon and evening of May 28 and morning of May 29, we were camped on Forest Service land just off Forest Service Road 685 approximately 1/4 mile of the trailhead to the Pawnee Buttes. We heard a loud hammering or popping sound that repeated irregularly 2-4 times a second. It competed with the noise of meadowlarks singing and the chorus of frogs, and was continuous. The sound was audible at numerous locations atop the mesa traversed by FS Road 685, the Pawnee Buttes overlook road and a major destination for those visiting the grasslands. The noise was commented on to us by others camping and hiking in the area as an annoyance. During the afternoon of May 29, we drove to the intersection of Weld County roads 110 and 111 where we observed and heard the very loud popping / hammering emanating from a working pumpjack operating by Whiting as identified above.

On May 31, 2016, COGCC staff, Chris Binschus, responded to the complaint by performing a field visit with the complainant and by performing an interim reclamation inspection.  The inspection was conducted on 5/31/16 and submitted to the operator on 6/1/16.  The following was observed and documented in the inspection:
1)Interim reclamation areas have not been reclaimed that reflects cropland reference areas with total percent plant cover of at least 80% of reference areas.  It was found that disturbed areas had on average 10 inches less of plant growth than reference areas, and disturbed areas lacked vegetative plant cover.  Although grass species are ok for a desirable seed mix, the rate of alfalfa is too low throughout most of the interim reclamation area.
2)Location has two List B Colorado Noxious weeds-Musk thistle (Cirsium nutans) and Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense). Need to control noxious weeds by 6/15/16 or sooner because both species are close to seeding out
3)Fence lines and gates were not re-installed to allow the landowner to continue a rotation grazing system with their livestock.  And a culvert was not re-installed creating ponding water on the western side of the main access road.
4)A portion of the southern access road needed road base because of muddy conditions from weather events.

Resolution:
The operator will re-seed the interim reclamation area with the recommended landowner seed mixture,  will control all noxious weeds ASAP, will re-install fence lines, gates, and a culvert, and will put road base down on a portion of the southern access road.  ",6/1/2016,N,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The survey was run at 40.16510, -105.3212.  Results of the inspection showed a LeqC of 72.4 db.  The sound survey recorded two stages and the down time between, the stages were pumped from 8:56 to 9:31 and from 9:42 to 10:13. The 72.4 db average was observed to be about constant through pumping and down times. Due to the locations position being adjacent to HWY 119 it is two inspectors (Jeff Rickard and Jim Precup) opinion that the 72.4 db is the background level for the area. The highest C-scale noise that was recorded was during the second stage and was 75.3 db. This maximum did not run for over fifteen minutes and was within 2 db of the background noise level (the meter has a 2 db error range). Even though the C-scale average was over the 65db limit outlined in Rule 802, the background levels of noise in the area are higher than that, and the sound survey showed that the fracking operation did not contribute to a higher C-scale noise than the background.

Complainant states: From the very beginning, the surrounding neighbors have never been told the truth about the proposed drilling site. At one point the neighbors were told of the specific techniques that the drilling company was going to use and at the next meeting all of that changed. This site is considered a LARGE UMA facility because of the number of proposed wells. Extraction failed to inform neighbors that this was considered a UMA facility. Extraction should be required to file the appropriate Form2a designating this site as a UMA facility. Even though this is a large facility, a developer is proposing to build residential houses right next to this site when the drilling is completed. Because this site sits in a bowl, the methane gases produced by the drilling can be expected to hang in the area and permeate the surrounding air affecting several neighboring house currently in existence. A thorough investigation needs to be completed and approval for drilling needs to be withheld until this investigation of Extraction's practices have been reviewed.","The COGCC engaged with Extraction and the local government regarding the Oil and Gas Location Assessment (OGLA) permit for the location.

Therefore, Im not sure how receptive the COGCC will be to my complaint about a huge oil and gas well pad that should not have been permitted in the city of Greeley. The Triple Creek Directional project off of 71st Avenue in Greeley, Colorado should never have been approved by the COGCC. It looks like Extraction tried to pull the wool over the eyes of the city, the COGCC, and the public. Extraction chose to ignore the road conditions, the bridge condition, the location of the site between a neighborhood and two emergency medical centers, or the downwind location of a city recreation center and two schools. Furthermore, there is only one through street, 20th Street, between Hwy 34 and 10th Street. This street is heavily traveled and must be crossed to get to the site. It is clear to residents that Extraction did not consider health, safety, and welfare. Neighbors did not receive letters of intent to drill. Neighbors found out about the site when the city set up meetings. I attended one such meeting in November of 2015, where a representative tried to wiggle out of installing a proposed pipeline to relieve truck traffic. This was about the time the price of oil tanked. If Extraction cares about health, safety, and welfare as its representative repeated robotically and ad nauseam at the six-hour city hearing, then the company should install the pipeline originally promised to residents. Extraction should have stopped the process after learning about a nearby bird nesting area. Instead, extraction opted to extend the time frame residents must endure the process of drilling. Extraction should have amended the location permit after expanding the area to add berms. However, the company opted to go around the COGCC rules Neighbors believe 22 wells, 22 tanks, and 2 produced water tanks should never have been permitted by the COGCC in the first place. Extraction should have reduced the number of wells and tanks after the COGCC defined a large facility. Therefore, I request the COGCC take a look at the entire process. First, make sure there are no private properties with homes within 1000 feet of the site. Second, require Extraction to prove that there are no possible alternate locationsnot just locations that are the most favorable to Extraction. Third, require Extraction to file an amended location permit for the berms and comply with the new COGCC rule for a large facility.","The COGCC engaged with Extraction and the local government regarding the Oil and Gas Location Assessment (OGLA) permit for the location.

At that meeting we questioned the location with them and the access to get back to that property as the only road entrance was at the top of the hill on 71st Avenue making it quite dangerous. We were told they were working on a different location and that the oil and gas would be piped out of the location to cut down on the amount of trips necessary to construct and run this large operation. At no time before or since have I ever heard from either of these companies direct in regards to any plans. Then at the December 8th public meeting they announced they were moving the access road to the bottom of the hill on 71st Avenue. There is no road at that location. There is and has been access for the County that has never once been used for any type of traffic and it is 30 feet from my home! My husband has mowed that area the whole time we have lived here to keep the weeds down and from coming on our property. I would have thought something that is going to affect me so drastically as this road they propose to use for what has now turned into trucking all of the equipment in and out as now they say it is to expensive to pipe out and that we can expect over 200,000 trips, 24/7 while the wells are being constructed and after for it to be hauled out!

It is my (and others') hope that the failures in procedure, the filings with incorrect information, and, in cases, facts left out in applications, and many other issues, as well as a pattern of problematic behavior on the part of Extraction and Mineral Resources preceding Extraction, will lead to this more than ill-advised, and, in fact, flagrantly inappropriate project to be examined again, with full light on all the facts on the subject, examples being- the violations of COGCC's own regulations, as well as incomplete information, misleading the COGCC, whether purposefully or not. I have done much due diligence over these last number of years and, as you request as much specificity as possible I submit the following: 1. Extraction failed to include in its COGCC Form 2A that Triple Creek is in a UMA, and did not comply with the requirements that would have resulted in greater public notice. 2. The location is considered a LARGE UMA Facility because it has many more than 8 wells (22, in fact) and is in a UMA. 3. No neighbors were contacted about the proposal from Mineral Resources or Extraction. I know residents contacted their neighbors about the 'neighborhood meetings', but weren't able to use UMA rules that give advanced notice to the government here in Greeley, nor a chance for remotely adequate neighborhood meetings. 4. COGCC, as you know, asked Mineral Resources more than once, to reach out to the residents most directly affected by Triple Creek and the new access road for it. Mineral Resources did not comply with COGCC's request. 5. Extraction DID NOT file an amended Form 2A, when it significantly expanded the well site, adding berms. NOTE: misrepresenting their 'disturbed area' allowed them (or so they believed), to avoid having to comply with the new rules and protocols of a LARGE UMA Facility. 6. At a neighborhood meeting in September 2014, Extraction committed to those present that they were going to use pipelines, so that the production facilities would be off site. Then- not until the critical city council appeal meeting in Greeley, on November 18, 2015, they stated that they had changed their minds and would NOT use piplelines and would locate all 22 tanks, separators and other equipment in the middle of the residential neighborhood (Triple Creek current location). The reason they gave: too expense. (This is not an allowed excuse to drop the requirement to use 'best practices'.. particularly when Extraction itself stated they would right from the gate.) 7. The already clear pattern of leaving out key information on legal application forms (i.e. 2A), refusing to respond to COGCC requests, waiting until there would be no built-in recourse to fundamentally negate an over one year old commitment to residents of the area in question- thereby changing their plan from a less invasive drilling project to a massive industri","The COGCC engaged with Extraction and the local government regarding the Oil and Gas Location Assessment (OGLA) permit for the location.

Since our neighborhood meeting in September, 2014, when we first learned of the Triple Creek Project, commitments have been made and commitments have been broken. The first and most egregious commitment was for a tankless site employing a pipeline to carry the oil to a remote storage facility. They made this commitment in spite of the fact that they have never done a tankless job. They have backed down and are now proposing a traditional tanked project with 22 oil storage tanks and separators, 4 vapor recovery units, 16 emission control devices, and 3 water storage tanks for completion. Every oil tank must be loaded with oil from the well and off-loaded to tanker trucks many times over the life of each well. Each round trip provides the opportunity for noise, dust, spills and VOC releases. This even earned a Shame on us comment from Synergys President Lynn Peterson in the Feb 9, 2016 issue of Oil & Gas 360 Magazine when speaking of Extractions reneging on their earlier pipeline commitment because of the price of oil. Over the course of this project to date, we have also heard commitments for providing high-line power from Xcel to an electric drilling rig to eliminate the need for a noisy, polluting diesel generator as well as commitments to use LACT to load trucks. They have both been reneged on, only to be made COAs or stated as commitments during the Planning Commission Hearing. The subject of phasing has changed with almost each meeting, whether neighborhood meetings, Planning Commission Hearings, or City Council Proceedings. However, after two of the meetings, Mr Thinglestadt (Petroleum Engineer) and Mr. Owens (President) have privately confided to my wife and me that they will likely drill two wells as a proof of concept and then come back at a more opportune time. This means that the construction period, with all 24 tanks and the 32-ft tall sound wall will show prospective home buyers that previously well-priced homes should now be available at substantially reduced prices for years into the future. Also their estimates of phase durations in most cases shows that the phasing they said in the meetings could not be completed during the 214-day construction window between red-tailed hawk nesting periods. Extraction is also one of only four of the estimated 500 oil and gas companies operating in Colorado who say they cant meet the April 1 deadline to implement new safety rules to limit spills during major floods. They may have a very legitimate excuse but Im certain that other companies faced hardships in meeting these new requirements. It seems to this skeptic that it is another indication of the companys character. Extraction was also forced to admit that, even with prior meeting mentioning of the anticipated replacement of both the Sheep Draw Bridge and 71st Avenue access highways between 2017 and 2019, they do not have contingency plans to deal with the bridge and road outages.

In three separate meetings, Extraction changed tank height from tankless to 20 foot to 12 foot.....How are we supposed to trust them? NONE of us, as the neighbors, were contacted about the proposal from Extraction or Mineral Resources. Residents, themselves, had to distribute notices to neighbors about the neighborhood meetings. The COGCC asked Mineral Resources TWICE to reach out to the neighbors that would be most directly affected by the location and new access road. Mineral Resources refused to comply with COGCC's request and the neighbor most impacted by the access road is deaf with hearing dogs who bark at approaching vehicles. This neighbor was never approached and the access is only 32 feet from her bedroom window. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Her dogs bark at approaching vehicles and they are older trained dogs. This will be the death of the dogs. Extraction failed to file an amended Form 2A when it proposed to greatly expand the well site to add berms. Neighbors believe that is bad policy to allow an operator to misrepresent their disturbed area to avoid falling under the new rules and regulations of a LARGE UMA FACILITY. ALSO, on September 25, 2014, Extraction committed to any of the few neighbors who were notified that they were going to use PIPELINES which would allow its production facilities to be located offsite. Then on November 18, 2015 meeting, Extraction announced that it had changed its proposal (mind) because it was LESS EXPENSIVE to keep all the 22 tanks, separators and other production equipment in the middle of the UMA neighborhood. We believe that since the COGCC staff now acknowledges that the location is definitely within a UMA, Extraction should be REQUIRED to comply with large UMA FACILITY regulations which require that it site facilities as far as possible from homes, employ the ""BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY"" to avoid or minimize adverse impacts to adjoining land uses"", and direct the COGCC Director to ""require a combination of best management practices and required mitigation measures...""

As it turns out, that scale requires that Extraction submit for approval at the highest level of community protection for urban drilling, which was not done in the first (Mineral Resources) application. I would respectfully request that the COGCC adhere to its own requirements by mandating a new and correct 2A from Extraction, the current owner.","The COGCC engaged with Extraction and the local government regarding the Oil and Gas Location Assessment (OGLA) permit for the location. COGCC found there was an error made by the original permittee on the OGLA, but did not find that any violation of COGCC Rules occurred at this Location, and no enforcement action will be taken. In order to remedy the inconsistencies between the State permits and Local USR, the operator committed to submitting a Form 2A to amend the permitted location and bring it into compliance with the Large UMA Facility Rules adopted by the COGCC in January 2016. The Form 2A application will be subject to the notice provisions of Rules 305A and 305, the consultation provisions of Rules 305A and 306, the mitigation measures described by Rule 604, and public comment as described in Rule 305.

Our water quality has changed alot, the taste and we have a white film in the sink and a greenish color by the handels in the bathrooms. We were told we have gas also in the sample we gave to my brother inlaw from the tap. We have had past problems on the ranch with Petroglyph. I spoke with Jason Kosola on the 4/22/16 and was told to make a complaint and then someone would come out and take a sample for testing.","A review of surrounding oil and gas wells in your area show the closest oil and gas well is located over one half mile from your water well. There are eight oil and gas wells within one mile of your well; however, there was no oil or gas production reported for any of these wells and all eight wells have been plugged.  COGCC records show that these wells were either drilled and abandoned or plugged and abandoned.  As a result, there are currently no active oil and gas wells within one mile of your water well.  

None of the 73 volatile or semi volatile organic compounds analyzed were detected in the sample from your well.  Due to the absence of the dissolved gasses methane, ethane, ethene and propane, as well as the absence of DRO or GRO, there is no indication of hydrocarbon contaminants in the ground water from your well.  There is no evidence of any impacts related to the oil & gas operations in the vicinity of your water well.

Iron reducing bacteria, sulfate reducing bacteria and slime forming bacteria were detected in the water from your well.  Disinfection of your well and water distribution system on a regular basis may improve the overall aesthetic quality of the water.  

The overall quality of your water has deteriorated since the previous COGCC water samples obtained from your well in 2007.  Eleven of the constituents shown on Table 1 increased slightly or significantly when compared to previous samples.  Total Dissolved Solids and Sulfate were found to be above domestic water standards.  

Elevated concentrations of sulfate and the presence of nitrate can indicate contaminants from the surface or near surface.  The increased sulfate and nitrate observed in your well may be caused by well construction issues or possibly fluctuations in the aquifer due to varying rates of recharge.  A lack of isolation between the screened interval of your well and shallower zones of ground water or the surface could cause communication between these zones resulting in increased sulfate and nitrate.  

The COGCC is an implementing agency of the groundwater standards for impacts associated with oil and gas exploration and production activities.  No impacts from oil and gas were found to have impacted your water well, as a result, your complaint has been closed.",5/19/2016,Y,N,,N,,Y,200439396.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This land is in southern Weld County. While we understand Kerr McGee's business strategy to delay fracking the wells because of low oil prices, we do not feel it to be a reasonable accommodation if we are to suffer loss of crops and income due to their strategy of delay, which is potentially profitable for them and costly for us. This particular quarter section of ground is irrigated by a center pivot sprinkler. We appreciate the fact that the wells are in the non irrigated pivot corners. There two corners with pads, one pad is in the SE corner and the other is in the SW corner. However, because of required setbacks, the wells are not in the corners as far they otherwise could be. Consequently, the drill pads had to be constructed in such a way that they extended so far out onto the ground irrigated by the pivot that it cannot make a full circle being that it cannot cross the pads. This leaves a very large pie shaped section that cannot be irrigated. So instead of losing only the productivity of the irrigated ground under the pads, which totals ten acres or so, we will lose the productivity of 40 or more acres in that pie shaped section. That's an unreasonable amount of irrigated farmland to have to give up. Kerr McGee wants us to grant them a waiver so the drilling pads can remain in place longer than COGCC rules allow. We would be willing to do so if they would agree to remove the plating and replace the topsoil on that portion of the pads that are under the pivot so we can farm and irrigate it, and if they have to replace the plating or otherwise use that portion of the pads in order to come back in to frack, that they do so only during the winter months. Or alternatively, if they do come back in during the growing season they compensate us for lost crops under the entire pie shaped section. As for the non irrigated portion of the pads not under the pivot sprinkler, it can stay as it is. But we really would like to get the irrigated land back. So far Kerr McGee are only stalling in coming up with an acceptable agreement. I plan to grow corn under the pivot and the optimum time for me to plant it is the first week of May. Any date after May 20 is too late. Time is running short. We have had horizontal wells drilled in pivot corners before with no interruption in irrigation even when the pads extended onto the irrigated ground. The drilling took place in late fall or winter and the wells were fracked immediately thereafter and the pads soon reclaimed. This is the first time we are being asked to make an unreasonable accommodation and feel we are being held hostage. It is not our fault that oil prices dropped, Otherwise the wells most likely would have been fracked already and reclamation underway. That is what we believed would happen.","COGCC communicated to Anadarko that in order for them to be in compliance with COGCC interim reclamation rules for these locations, Anadarko would have to perform one of the following actions:

	Agree to commence completion operations prior to December 10, 2016 on the southwest location and January 3, 2017 on the southeast location.
	Commence interim reclamation right away.
	Finalize a waiver agreement with the surface owner and secure a formal variance from the COGCC to extend completion operations beyond the December 10, 2016 and January 3, 2017 dates.
After detailed discussions, Anadarko made the decision to change their operational plans and commence completion operations prior to the December 10, 2016 and January 3, 2017 dates, therefore not delaying completions past one year from releasing the rig. These actions put Anadarko in compliance with COGCC reclamation rules.  

Additionally, COGCC verified with Anadarko that their intentions are to complete these wells in the summer of 2016 and perform interim reclamation shortly after.  These actions should ensure their operations will not impact your 2017 growing season.  

Based on the above described investigation, the COGCC has determined that no violations of COGCC rules occurred related to your complaint.  Accordingly, the COGCC has closed the complaint and will not issue a notice of alleged violation (NOAV) related to this complaint.",5/6/2016,Y,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mud is also being tracked from immediately south of the hay wall at the location and there is a pile of loose sand/dirt/rocks next to the entrance that is creating extra dust. Between the mud, rocks and dust, it is miserable to drive along that stretch of the road (it is much worse during times when there are lots of trucks driving to and from the location and kicking up rocks and dirt).

Neighbors ATC are dozens of individuals who live within 900  1,500 feet from the proposed Triple Creek location. Its members are comprised of families, working people, and retirees who live in a residential neighborhood in Greeley, Colorado. Neighbors ATC are formally submitting this complaint because Mineral Resources / Extraction Oil and Gas failed to acknowledge on its Form 2A that the Triple Creek location falls within an Urban Mitigation Area (UMA) or to comply with the requirements that would have provided greater public notice. Furthermore, Mineral Resources failed to file an amended Form 2A when it proposed to greatly expand the well site. Neighbor ATC are requesting that an amended Form 2A be required and the proposal be reviewed for what it is: a Large UMA Facility. Background Mineral Resources filed its Form 2A for the Triple Creek location within the City of Greeley on Christmas Eve  December 24, 2013. From the very beginning, Mineral Resources demonstrated a reluctance to notify neighbors of its proposed location. The Form 2A proposed 22 wells and 22 tanks within 1,177 feet of the closest home. After the COGCC staff notified Mineral Resources that the closest home was actually less than 1,000 feet from proposed emission control devices, the operator sent a revised drawing that placed the well heads and production equipment 1,001 feet from the nearest home on the NE side and 1,005 feet from the nearest home on the SW. (Location Drawing, Doc #1668048). At one point, Mineral Resources proposed to use modular large volume tanks (MLVTs) to reduce truck traffic to the site. Mineral Resources ultimately declined to use the MLTVs because that would require additional notifications due to being within 1,000 feet of Building Units (Approved Form 2A, 3/31/2014 General Comments). COGCC staff Doug Andrews asked whether Mineral Resources had met with the neighbor (Ms. Dawn Stein), who lives within 30 feet of the proposed access road, to make sure she understood there would be an increase in oil field traffic. Mr. Andrews wrote that he was trying to get a sense of how neighborly Mineral Resources is being with regard to that homeowner. (Andrews email correspondence dated Jan 16, 2014 and Feb. 18, 2014, Doc#168277). Mineral Resources admitted that they did not meet with the neighbor. Ms. Stein is a member of Neighbors ATC and has confirmed that she was never contacted by Mineral Resources and was not aware of Mineral Resources proposed location until months after it had been approved by the COGCC. Even though Mineral Resources map showed that the closest home was 1,001 feet from the oil and gas facilities, the location itself was still within an Urban Mitigation Area (UMA). As can be seen in the attached map, 13 homes are within a 1,000 foot semi-circle of the proposed oil and gas location","The COGCC engaged with Extraction and the local government regarding the Oil and Gas Location Assessment (OGLA) permit for the location.

Complainant states: I live at 498 CR 132. There is currently a gas well that is being re-worked in my neighborhood on CR 131. The work has been going on now for a couple of weeks. Tonight, just now, for the second time, I have gone outside to smell a strong order of offal; industrial (oil & gas) offal. I don't know what else to call it, but it is nauseous. I really don't know much about re-working gas wells, I'm sure there are some venting emissions that occur. But it is curious to me that during the day when I can hear them working over there I don't smell a thing. Are there state or county regulations that regulate emissions from these wells? Are they monitored? Who enforces the rules? My paranoia around this is they are venting off pollutants at night when no one is around.","SW Inspection Supervisor conducted inspections and infrared surveys of former Red Mesa Holdings wells in vicinity (within 1 mile) of complainants residence. The Talbot-Wideman 13-1, Dye Hard 3 and Haun-Delaney 1 wells were found to be properly shut in and not leaking gas as confirmed by FLIR Gasfinder infrared camera. No odors were observed at time of inspections of these wells and associated tanks. It can not be conclusively determined that these locations were the source of the odors complainant had experienced in prior months.

2 other operators have wells in the area, Williford Resources and Beeman Oil and Gas. These operations can not be ruled out as the source or contributing source of the odors complainant had experienced.

Further investigation with similar atmospheric conditions as a perceived odor event within a shorter time would need to be conducted to definitively determine the probable source or sources of odors. Based on 3 months without any additional perceived odor events by complainant, staff closes complaint.

Complainant states: At County Road 7 Weld County Road 38 turns into a gravel road. Large oil and gas trucks are going down this road kicking up very large dust cloads which travel to homes directly east of County road 7. To the best of my knowledge they have never put down anything on this gravel road to cut down the dust that is creating a health hazard to everyone in the vicinity. Most of are winds come from the west which takes these large dust clouds and deposits them in our neighborhoods. Sometimes the trucks are one right after another and somethings needs to be done to protect our health and well being.

Complainant has also contacted the CDPHE OG Health Program.

Complainant states: They have recently put up permanent lighting. I'm assuming they are to assist the process of truck drivers pumping oil into their tankers. If that is the case, then why are the lights 25ft off the ground, pointing at our neighborhood, not just the pumping area, and constantly on regardless of whether or not there are trucks or personnel present? Some of the lighting is directed towards our neighborhood and is bright enough to illuminate our bedroom at night, even though we live approximately 1/2 mile away. We filed a similar complaint approximately five months ago and the problem regarding the lighting was resolved. Then they changed from temporary lighting to permanent lighting and it is once again intruding into our home. In fact, it is even brighter now than it was previously. We thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Lights are described as elevated, not from truck traffic, and continuous.","Complaint #:	200439199

Nature of complaint: Noise/Lights

Field Inspector Actions:
 
On 12-31-2015, I was contacted by COGCC staff in reference to a noise and lighting complaint in the Windsor area.   

I contacted the complainant and he indicated he was experiencing lighting and noise issues coming from the Winder location east of his home.  The complainant said at night time he noticed the light from the location was coming thru his bedroom window, and he could hear a loud humming noise coming from the location.  

The complainant indicated he had called in on a previous complaint involving the temporary lighting at the location and when he did Extraction had taken care of the situation at that time but when they installed the new lighting, the problem started all over again. Complainant also indicated he was still experiencing noise but that the noise was not the true nature of his complaint it was the lighting has Extraction had installed sound walls to mitigate the noise.

I went to the location and performed a inspection of the location and I observed the new lighting appeared to be facing toward the ground, but the lighting on the east side of the location could be repositioned so it would not cause any light pollution toward the west. I also observed the walls which the complainant indicated where installed to mitigate the noise. See inspection Doc# 673802974 for details of inspection and attached photos.


 

I spoke with Extraction production foreman Cory Eikenberg, I advised him of the complaint the COGCC had received and suggested they reposition the light which had been installed on the east end of the sound walls to the north and west end of the locations in an attempt to redirect any possible light pollution coming from the lights.  Cory agreed to re position the lights that evening.

When I went to the location on 3-11-2015 I met with Keith Sparkx of A&W Water services and Long Peak water District  employees who identified the leaking water at the fire hydrant was on the Longs Peak Water District side and the water on the ground was fresh water caused by a leaking weep hole on the fire hydrant.",3/11/2015,Y,N,,N,,N,,12338446.0,05-123-38446,123.0,Weld,2A-19H-E368,Bohrer,,f,f,f,t,435067.0,435070.0,BOHRER 19H-E168,PR,2015-05-05,10633.0,CRESTONE PEAK RESOURCES OPERATING LLC,90750.0,WATTENBERG,5060.2,-105.05245,40.21448,495537.0,4451560.0,19.0,3n,68w,SWNW,6,1362.0,N,762.0,W,PLANNED LatLong,t,t,f,f,f,f,t,t,2014-09-13,2014-09-19,2014-12-23,f,95.0,f,http://cogcc.state.co.us/cogis/FacilityDetail.asp?facid=12338446&type=WELL,2017-02-24 11:00:00,2017-02-24 11:00:00,f

January 15, 2015 they replaced the 3 cylinder motor with a V8 motor.  I called Troy w/PDC that same evening and advised them it is entirely too loud.  Troy advised the new motor was supposed to be quieter than the 3 cylinder motor and they were going to install more sound barriers.

Location: Barefoot facility, Co 66 and Weld Counyy Road 13, southwest corner

Continuation of an existing noise complaint investigated on 01/05/2015. The noise this morning is worse than ever before - I probably have excess of 70 db inside a closed house with closed windows, nearly 1/2 mile from the site. The original noise complaint was investigated by COGCC, recommendation were made to the operator, but as of today none of the changes have been made. The operator seems to generate the most noise when they know that the investigator will not be available to check on the noise (e.g. during the week, it's been the worst from about 8pm to 3 or 4 am the next morning.","On 1-14-2015, I was contacted by the COGCC office in reference to two loud noise complaints and vehicles tracking
mud from the Barefoot locations located near the intersection of Hwy 66 and Weld County Rd 13. The complaints
were documented in Form 18 doc #s 200421420 and #200421435. I contacted the two complainants and both
indicated the noise they had experienced was increasingly louder on Saturday 1-10-2015. Mrs. Schreiber also
complained about traffic coming off of these e locations and tracking mud onto WCR 13. After speaking to the
complainants, I proceeded to perform site inspections at the following locations:
Barefoot 30C-25HZ No activity at this location. Flow back equipment was on location but there were no active
operations on location. See inspection Doc# 673801675 for further information.
Barefoot 32N-25HZ Active frac operation at location. Upon inspection, I observed mud transferred from the location to
WCR 13. I observed a vehicle tracking pad on the lease road to location but the pad had been filled in by mud and
debris which allowed the mud from location to be transferred to WCR 13. Upon entering the site I observed noise
mitigation to the east of the location with hay bales set up as sound mitigation. The area toward the northeast, which
is toward the complainants houses, did not have any sound mitigation set up. I performed a sound study approx 350
to the northeast of the frac operation. Results of the sound study indicated the frac operation was operating within
the operational limits of the COGCC sound rules. See Inspection Doc# 673801670 for further information, results of
sound study, attached photos and corrective actions of vehicle tracking issues.

The incident started a day before Thanksgiving and the noise levels have been too high to lead a normal life at our place.
There is a continuous rumbling noise at our place, 24x7, and the noise is especially bad at nighttimes. We are unable to sleep at night because of this noise and this has affected our daily life and work productivity. My wife works from home, and she is unable to perform her duties 100% because of lack of sleep and noise throughout the day. My daughter is 3 years old and she was scared to sleep in her room alone because of the noise and has been sleeping at our room for the whole month of December. We all wake up frequently at night because of the noise and unable to go back to sleep afterwards.
Along with the noise, we have felt tremors and walls/windows shaking due to the noise vibrations. I am concerned whether this would cause any structural damages to our home.
My wife is pregnant and we have decided to move from this location due to the concerns with this fracking site being so close. The noise issues currently are terrible and there would be more noise issues when Encana actually fracks the wells. We have been without proper sleep and rest and it is affecting our jobs and daily lives.","The COGCC implemented a new public complaint process on January 8, 2015.  This complaint was received prior to the new process and was either investigated and resolved without formal documentation or was not fully investigated.

It seems that it has gotten louder over the last week or so.  It's making it very difficult to sleep. It sounds like a semi truck is parked beside our bedroom window with its engine running all night that or a 747 is flying above, vibrating our room. I have to turn on a sound app just to try to block the irritating sound and vibration. It really doesn't help.  I am here all day and it's definitely most irritating at night.  I would want you to sample the sounds at night sometime between 9:00 p.m. and Midnight.  Last night was especially bad.  I am not sure if the wind had something to do with it.  I don't like to complain, but this is irritating.  This is a neighborhood and not a work site.

This document was the October 8, 2015 ""Application"" which stated that the (March 2015) 30 day response period had passed and that they had no objections. The Association did not receive any documents to review prior to this and did not know about the wells nor the response period. The only indication to me of wells going in was the area marked in farm land southwest of us over 1 1/2 miles away. The HOA also still has not received notice of the April hearing. Some homeowners in the affected southern half of the community have also just started receiving their first notification, the Application and the Notice of Hearing. They also did not receive the original (March 2015) documents. Kerr-McGee holds the lease for oil and gas in the Elms land. They have informed us that they have made an agreement with Extraction Oil & Gas for royalties in the Elms pooled area. We believe that Extraction Oil & Gas has not properly notified the Elms Association, which owns land within and at the southern border of the Elms, or our affected homeowners. We did not contact anyone until now, as we thought our opportunity to be involved had passed. After researching, we realized we were supposed to have been sent the earliest documents and now that we see the hearing is soon, we wanted to notify COGCC that the HOA and the affected homeowners should be notified properly.

Field Inspector Actions:
 
On 12-31-2015, I was contacted by COGCC staff in reference to a noise and lighting complaint in the Windsor area.   

I contacted the complainant and he indicated he was experiencing lighting and noise issues coming from the Winder location east of his home.  The complainant said at night time he noticed the light from the location was coming thru his bedroom window, and he could hear a loud humming noise coming from the location.  

The complainant indicated he had called in on a previous complaint involving the temporary lighting at the location and when he did Extraction had taken care of the situation at that time but when they installed the new lighting, the problem started all over again. Complainant also indicated he was still experiencing noise but that the noise was not the true nature of his complaint it was the lighting has Extraction had installed sound walls to mitigate the noise.

I went to the location and performed a inspection of the location and I observed the new lighting appeared to be facing toward the ground, but the lighting on the east side of the location could be repositioned so it would not cause any light pollution toward the west. I also observed the walls which the complainant indicated where installed to mitigate the noise. See inspection Doc# 673802974 for details of inspection and attached photos.


 

I spoke with Extraction production foreman Cory Eikenberg, I advised him of the complaint the COGCC had received and suggested they reposition the light which had been installed on the east end of the sound walls to the north and west end of the locations in an attempt to redirect any possible light pollution coming from the lights.  Cory agreed to re position the lights that evening.

Complainant states: 
For a period of month now, starting in early December (maybe late November) there has been an intermittent but overwhelming petroleum type smell. The smell most closely resembles WD40. It sometimes gets so severe that sustained time outdoors will result in nausea and headaches. It appears to occur more often when the wind is blowing gently out of the south, or not most severely when there is no wind at all. We had hoped that it was related to all of the active drilling and fracking that had been taking place during the fall, however, the smell has gotten more severe since those operations have ceased/dwindled. We own a home in this area and we are concerned that this going to be considered a ""normal"" condition if we live in this area.
Any time there is a strong wind out of the West or Northwest it difficult to notice the smell/odor. It does appear to be more prevalent when the wind is blowing out of the south or when there is no wind at all. If the area in question is inspected/visited on a windy day, you will not be able to notice the odor. I am not 100% sure that it is originating from the South and would appreciate a thorough inspection of the locations to the North and the Northwest.
We live 1/2 west of WCR17 on WCR42 south of the Johnstown proper in the Pioneer Ridge subdivision. The issue is most prevalent on WCR42 1/2-3/4 mile of 17.
While I admit that I have not isolated the precise cause of this severe odor/pollution, there is a tank battery to the south of us operated by PDC Energy Services. I suspect this set of tanks is the most likely culprit. With that being said, we hope that the COGCC will investigate the diminishing air quality in this area and act accordingly. We have attempted to contact PDC, but have managed to call outside of their hours of operation each time.","

Field Inspector Actions:

Field Inspector called complainant and left message. Field Inspector located the closest oil and gas installation and conducted a complete inspection, document number 674003482.

This location was well maintained and no active venting or odors were detected.  
Inspector also visited additional locations to the north and west of the complainants residence and oil and gas facilities to the south of Weld County 42 with similar results (no venting or odors detected).  
Odor was detected coming from a mulch transfer station operated by Renewable Fiber (800) 888-0374.
See map below for relative positioning of facilities.
Due to the Field Inspectors belief that the source of the odor was not oil and gas related the complainants information was passed along to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, case number: 5597858

Complainant states: Property, ground and surface water, and soils on the Little Fishes LLC property, including the wildlife habitat and waters of the United States continue to be at risk from activities at this location, because the operating companies have failed to adequately plan and implement actions, including spill prevention and control, storm water management (best management practices), and reclamation of areas disturbed and outside their legal leased area. It has now been more than two years since various notices of corrective actions required were issued, according to COGCC records. Yet the operators still have not implemented an effective storm water management plan and other plans to prevent or control runoff of storm water carrying contaminants from their activities, and have not demonstrated to an acceptable recognized standard the results of their clean-up and other work on site to comply with federal, state, tribal, and local laws and rules. The three companies have continued to operate in conditions and with materials not properly protected so that discharges and therefore contamination to water and soils off the well pad can continue with any storm event. They have not complied with the provisions of Section 906 regarding reporting and coordination on releases that have occurred and which have been documented both by on-site inspection and by laboratory testing.

The efforts to get the companies (Catamount, Williams, and Conoco Phillips) to take action would take too long to detail here, as would conversations with other agencies and organizations.

Other organic materials have also been shown to contaminate groundwater.

Complainant states: TBA contamination of groundwater in Las Animas County continues to be an issue. Water produced from methane wells and documented to be contaminated with TBA is spread on roads and discharged into drainage areas. Why is this still allowed even though our groundwater is known to be contaminated? No sampling of containment ponds near the Cottontail Pass compressor station has been done. Why not? Other ponds used for collection produced waters have not been sampled. Why not? Project 2130 has shown that TBA contamination is real and a problem in many water wells around Las Animas County. Yet, it contains no facts or data to show the possible source whether is be natural or human caused. It does contain many opinions which are not based in fact. The opinions come directly fro the COGCC and the oil and gas business but are not supported by any evidence. For instance, no explanation of where high levels of TBA in the Sachinator MW1 came from. It does say that Toluene found in the same well is human caused. Opinions stated in the report include the source of contamination is naturally occurring. This is not backed up by facts, data or evidence of any kind. Another opinion states that there is no evidence the the oil and gas industry is the source. This statement however is completely false. There is plenty of evidence that they are responsible. They blew the well caps off of water wells while drilling. Wells in that area are contaminated. High levels of TBA are found in the Sanchinator MW1 as well as toluene. TBA is now found in water wells that were once clean. Methane in the groundwater is increasing indicating that gas well drilling has opened up new pathways between the production zones and the groundwater zones. So the statement that there is no evidence that the oil and gas industry in not responsible is blatantly false. Other scientists at the Colorado School of Mines have stated that the report creates questions and that the only true statement in the report is that our groundwater is contaminated. They also stated that it is highly unlikely that this contamination is from naturally occurring sources. This is to request that the COGCC protect the interests of persons owning groundwater rights in Las Animas County by continuing to study the contamination. Monitoring and analysis needs to continue. Additional water wells should be tested. Ponds should be tested. Discharges to roads and into drainage areas should be tested. Water wells known to be contaminated should continue to be tested. The party responsible for the contamination should be held accountable and be made to compensate water right owners for the loss of their","Multiple gas wells around complainants well have been sampled for TBA.  To date no TBA has been found in any oil and gas facilities within one half mile of complainant well.

Upon my discussion with Extraction personnel it was determined the noise heard by the complaint came from the flowback process in which the excess gas during the drill out process was flared using an in closed flare to burn off excess gas as a safety precaution. This increase was for only a short time and was a direct result of a safety procedure used during the flowback process.

It is vibrating the living hell out of our home at all hours of the night keeping our family from sleep. This is absolutely unacceptable. The noise and the vibrations need to be terminated. How is it possible that you, a governing body, allows these rigs to operate so close to neighborhoods filled with families? The air pollution, noise pollution, and physical vibrations in the middle of the night are horrible. If these rigs are going to operate this close to residential areas they should NOT be allowed to operate in the middle of the night! They need to take their operation out into the endless open space of Weld county where there are not residences. This is an abomination.

Tip or Complaint:  Recently speaking with an employee of WPX who stated that on one of the recent wells that were shut down that during drilling they hit an underground spring and the well started gushing water. the well was capped and shut down do avoid getting government agencies involved. there is suspected contamination of ground water with fracking fluid. the employee stated that they had thought about coming forward but were concerned about employer retribution as well as future employment if that occurred
Specific Directions:  I do not know the location of the site and was unsure of how to tactfully extricate the information without giving away my intentions. however I do believe that with some research it can be found out because it is one of the recent 380 wells that were shut down and geological proximity to known underground springs may narrow the results. I hope this information helps

Tight curves and corners between the well area and wherever all of the huge semis keep going.

Complainant states: Wells are going along CR 13, south of the train tracks. Since yesterday there's a ton of semi trucks creating serious safety issues. Here are just some of the issues: 
1 - semis going north and turning off of CR 13 to get to the wells are crossing lanes into oncoming traffic. Some are completely into the southbound lane to make the turn. Today I was driving south and had to slow down to a near stop in order to avoid a head on collision. 
2 - Traffic going south may be forced to stop for the turning semis on an active railroad track 
3 - Semis going south on CR 13 CANNOT make it around the s curve without crossing the double yellow line and some going completely into the north lane. Cars and school buses have to stop and some have to pull to the side or even back up. This is a horrible safety risk, as confirmed by poudre school district and windsor. Today I saw 3 buses forced to navigate the sharp curves and corners while working to avoid at least 3 oncoming semi trucks. One bus was very close to the shoulder and embankment in order to avoid the semi in the curve. 
4 - Semis going north on CR 13 are hugging the s-curve to avoid oncoming vehicles that aren't able to stop in enough time to give the trucks both lanes. I was behind one semi yesterday and it's back tires went off the road, hit the piled up ice on the shoulder and the whole back of the truck rocked before it kicked back onto the pavement. I thought the truck was going to lose it's load and tip off the road. 
5 - Semis turning north onto CR 13 from Jacoby rd (68 1/2) cannot make the turn without using the southbound lane. Issue is the same coming from east and west directions Trucks are stopping on a small, narrow bridge and along the road until there is no traffic at the stop sign on CR 13. 
6 - Even though the school district asked extraction not to have trucks running during the time that the school buses are taking kids to school and home, extraction is not willing to honor that request. EXTRACTION Oil & Gas have been provided times when these buses are on their routes and yet, have done NOTHING to delay truck traffic under their control in order to do everything possible to prevent a tragic accident. 
7 - Semis are creating delays and I have already seen several people passing the semis on a short stretch of straight road. With the increased traffic and trucks turning out from the well area, and several driveways and bus stops along this stretch, unnecessary risks are happening. 
8 - large amounts of rock and dirt are being tracked onto CR 13 from the well location. safety concern if those rocks are kicked up and hit a vehicle or motorcycle.

I thought Extraction was going to use an electric rig so told this to my neighbors and told them this operation is nothing to worry about. Seems Extraction has changed their mind and is now going to use a diesel rig for this 13 well pad. I really hate to be the one complaining because I work for another oil company but I can already see the issue this will be with my neighbors. Is it possible for extraction to bring in the electric rig that was proposed? Thanks for looking into this.,"COGCC Permit Manager Jane Stanczyk determined the following: 

This is an Designated Setback Location (a Buffer Zone), so the Form 2A was required by Rule 604.c to have BMPs or COAs for mitigation measures for several requirements, including noise:

604.c.(2)A:
Noise. Operations involving pipeline or gas facility installation or maintenance, or the use of a drilling rig, are subject to the maximum permissible noise levels for Light Industrial Zones, as measured at the nearest Building Unit. Short-term increases shall be allowable as described in 802.c. Stimulation or re-stimulation operations and Production Facilities are governed by Rule 802.

The rule does not specify the exact measures.

The Form 2A for Extraction's Westwind Location # 159698 was approved 1-16-2015 with this operator-proposed Noise BMP:
The drill site will be powered by electricity, mitigating the majority of noise from drilling operations. Sound walls and/or hay bales will be used to surround the well site during drilling operations.

Each of the APDs for the 13 wells on the location also have this BMP.

Extraction submitted a Sundry on 1-19-2016 for the Location to remove that noise BMP and replace it with these 2 noise BMPs:
For this location, temporary sound walls will be installed along the west side and a portion of the north side. Hay bales will be utilized around the remainder of the location.

An ambient sound study will be performed before any operations take place and continuous monitoring will be installed for the duration of the drilling and completions. The monitors will be checked during operations, and if necessary, additional sound walls/hay bales will be installed immediately.

The sundry was approved by COGCC staff on 1-29-2016 per Rule 303.d:

303.d. Revisions to Form 2 or Form 2A. Prior to approval of the Form 2 or Form 2A permit application, minor revisions or requested information may be provided by contacting the COGCC staff. After approval, any substantive changes shall be submitted for approval on a Form 2 or Form 2A. A Sundry Notice, Form 4, shall be submitted, along with supplemental information requested by the Director, when non-substantive revisions are made after approval, and no additional fee shall be imposed.

We consider this change made to the Location to apply to each well, outwith a Form 4 for each of them.",2/2/2016,N,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The COGCC does not typically exercise its jurisdiction over the damages you allege.

Complainant states Road 18 is not a county road, and is a ""privately owned, unnamed driveway that goes across Leonard Rasmussen's property, not on the Section Line. The Power of Decision Making for the road, from the most power to the least, is as follows: #1: Leonard Rasmussen - the sole owner of the property that the 'Rd 18', the Driveway, is on. #2: All Prescriptive and Necessary Easement holders because of Ingress and Egress: ...#3: Those with a Deeded Agricultural easement. #4. Encana has a Colorado State Right of Way for production to access their leased minerals.""
Complainant reports: recycled asphalt was laid on Rd. 18 four years ago. Approx 5 years ago Kenyon's property had 4 wells installed/ developed by Encana. To access the Kenyon's (now the Sandstead's property) during the first 2 years they used Rd 18 (a narrow, one lane, gravel driveway) for 1/2 mile. Road 18 became a washboard mess. The recycled asphalt removed the ability of stakeholders to properly grade the road as had been happening for over 20 years, before the recycled asphalt was laid. Some stakeholders, did not want recycled asphalt. The asphalt changed the nature of the road was neither a necessary decision nor a consensus decision made by ALL stakeholders; the person who owns the road and all of the people who have prescriptive and necessary easements. 
Road 18 is a major problem. Large sections of it get washboard and because of the asphalt the local residents are unable to grade it properly. Encana, by law, has to 'Reclaim' damages that occur during drilling and fracking. This means, that Encana should have 'returned the road to its original state' the condition and type of road that it was before the Fracking occurred. Encana had no right to change the nature of 'Rd. 18' without full Stakeholder consensus. The recycled asphalt has created a big washboard and maintenance problem for Stakeholders. 
Per Colorado State Law: Encana has the legal obligation to return the road to 'pre-fracking' condition. To properly finish the job of Relcamation of Rd. 18 from the 4 years ago  Encana needs to: Dig up the 8"" of recycled asphalt and lay 4"" of 3/4"" gravel mounded down the entire 1/2 mile of Rd. 18 (Road 18s original condition). The decision to have recycled asphalt laid was illegal and did not involve all of the Stakeholders in the decision to do it. I will be requesting that Encana, on its own bill, return Rd. 18 to its original condition.","On January 12, 2016, COGCC staff visited Road 18 to document road conditions. However, conditions did not allow for a thorough assessment. 

On January 28, 2016, COGCC staff performed an inspection on Road 18 conditions. Each point of interest was spatial referenced using a GPS and photo(s) taken at each point. COGCC staff found, that on January 28, 2016, Road 18 was in fair/good condition. Five points of interest were identified (Pictures 1-3 and 6-9) as having either minor to moderate rutting and/or washboard conditions. Refer to attached pictures documenting current road conditions as of January 28, 2016 (Doc.#682400344).

COGCC staff spoke with Toby Sachen, EnCana representative, on February 3, 2016 with updates on COGCCs findings with lease Road 18.

Field Inspector Actions:
 
On 12-31-2015, I was contacted by COGCC staff in reference to a noise and lighting complaint in the Windsor area.   

I contacted the complainant and he indicated he was experiencing lighting and noise issues coming from the Winder location east of his home.  The complainant said at night time he noticed the light from the location was coming thru his bedroom window, and he could hear a loud humming noise coming from the location.  

I went to the location and performed a inspection of the location and I performed a sound study at the location approx 350 to the west of the location toward the receptor of the noise complaint.  See inspection Doc# 673802806 for details of inspection and attached photos and attached sound study.

During my inspection I observed 2 light plants at location one on the east end of location with lights pointing toward the center of the location and toward the ground and second light plant was located on the south end of location with the lights positioned toward the center of the location and toward the ground per COGCC rules.  I also identified the noise coming from the location as the compressors on the location which were running at the time of the inspection and had temporary sound walls placed around them.

I spoke with Extraction production foreman Cory Eikenberg, I advised him of the complaint the COGCC had received and suggested they reposition the light plants to the north and west end of the locations in an attempt to redirect any possible light pollution coming from the light plants.  Cory agreed to re position the light plants and he indicated permanent sound walls were scheduled to be put inplace around the compressors at a later date.

We are extremely upset today due to the unbearable noise, lights and vibration coming from the drilling site just outside our back door. When we were told about this site, we were told it would be more quiet, with tall walls built around it to minimize noise and disruption. To date, this has not been the case. This site is literally just a stone throw outside our back door. The wall is not up yet, however the lights at night are horrible, and the noise was so loud last night that even though we put a fan set on high in our bedroom, we could hear the noise over it. And this morning, the vibrations are so bad I can feel them in my body. Putting my leg against the desk, I can feel the desk rattling. It's very un-nerving. This is just unacceptable to put up with for the next year! Why are the walls not built yet? The noise limit is definitely being exceeded here, especially at night. Why would someone put this site so close to our homes? Are there limits to noise levels at night so we can sleep, at least? Thank you for answering my questions. I would love to speak to someone about this.

This past Friday, while the farrier was shoeing one of my horses, PDC Energy came on the my property with heavy equipment without notice. When I called PDC Energy to inquire about the reason for the heavy equipment entering my property without notification, I was told they were there to replace a separator. However, it turns out the separator does not actually need to be replaced because PDC Energy has decided to permanently plug the well. A PDC rep, Mark Alissi, came by and asked the workers to stop the work, which they did. However, the workers parked their tractor, next to the fence with the separator and planned on leaving it there until Monday. I learned this after calling PDC later that afternoon to determine when the tractor was going to be off my property. Well, they came and got the tractor Saturday morning, but there is a second separator sitting outside the fence enclosure for the original separator that is still sitting inside the fence. After asking Mark Alissi for some information on what is happening with this and when this separator will be gone, I have yet to hear back from him. I last spoke with him at ~8 am on Saturday morning. It is now after 1 pm on Monday afternoon. I have continued to ask PDC Energy to provide me with notification when they would like to do work on the well on my property. I own horses and am regularly exercising them in my arena as are my 6 and 10 year old daughters.

I have been witness to multiple cover up and behind the scenes safety violations in the transmission and pipeline safety departments. I have been threatened with physical violence and termination if I did not stop voicing my concerns. The physical threats came from Jim Arehart, Ryan Echer, Jay Fowler and Joe Quinn. Termination Threats came from Michael Noon and Landon Haack. I am in fear of my safety and employment. The complaints I have are; 1. The MAOP verification tests that were conducted on the pipeline between Glenwood Springs and Edwards Colorado in 2014 were improperly documented. In Jan and Feb of 2015 a Former pipeline safety employee in Glenwood Springs was trying to document and verify the MAOP testing, he discovered that there were no records for this testing. When he refused to cooperate with falsifying these records he was terminated. 2. There are may falsified records and many safety concerns and defects at the Slick rock facility in South West Colorado. This facility was rebuilt in 2012 2013. There were dozens of falsified welding records on faulty weld joints. The Employee that raised this concern was terminated. Additonaly I have seen pictures of a blow down device that is more than 30 feet of the ground and used frequently without any fall safety devices. 3. There is a pipeline defect on the Grand Mesa at the Big Creek Camp Ground on our 6 inch transmission line. I read an email from the Pipeline Safety Guy that was fired last Spring that was written to Jim Arehart. It complained that this defect exceeded the allowable size for a dent, was never X-rayed, and was repaired with some type of cast by personnel there were not qualified to applied the cast. This defect is very near a very popular camp site. This kind of reminds me of Carlsbad. When I was asking about this defect while at dinner with Arehart, Quinn, and Echer, my personal safety was threatened if I did not keep my mouth shut. A month later Haack pulled me aside in Golden and informed me that he had been in conference with Mr. Noon and Mr Weakly. That if I continued ""nosing around Pipeline Integrity Business"" I would be terminated. There have been many records on our S: Drive with evidence of these issues and dozens more that have been destroyed to cover the evidence. Please audit this companies Pipeline Safety program. P.S. I have been talking with several of my friends and contacts in the Delta office. I have been told that there are many dozens dangerous repairs on the distribution lines. One that all of them talked about is a line that has been smashed and dented for a length of more than 200 feet in a creek crossing.

Nature of complaint:  Odor

Field Inspector Actions:

Field Inspector Craig Carlile called complainant and left message, went to the complainants residence, no odor was observed at the time. Wind was light from the north.  Complaint contained the observation that source of the odor may be from the rig approximately ž of mile to the west of the residence. Field inspector visited the location and performed an interview with the company representative (Shawn McIntyre) and submitted field inspection report.

This is multi-well location (11 Wells), at the time of the inspection the rig was setting up to begin drilling and setting surface casing to 1500 ft for the Fairview 2 well, API 05-123-41666. Previous activity (at approximate time of complaint) was performing the same operation for the Fairview 3 well. At this location, the conductor casing has been set and the will be setting the surface casing sequentially and then return to each location for the completion of the well.
A water based mud was being used to for the surface drilling operation and no drilling chemicals were on the location.



Summary:
At the time of the inspection, this location did not exhibit any petroleum/drilling related sources of odor. 
Inspector intends to return to the area 12/8/2015 to visit/inspect nearby locations searching for source of odor.

And request State to investigate the fire ASAP before causal evidence is disturbed. 

Complainant reports location as 1900 block of South County Road 157, Strasburg.","COGCC Field Inspector Sherman contacted Mr. Behrens, who is the pumper for the well, at approximately 9:30 am on 11/25/2015 about the vertical heater treater fire south of Strasburg, Colorado. He identified the well as the Reeves 28-31 that is owned by Overland Resources LLC with API# 05-005-06345. Per Mr. Behrens the landowner heard a loud sound and saw the fire at the treater located at the well's tank battery at approximately 6:10-6:15 am on 11/25/2015.

The local fire department was called and Vic Behrens was called at approximately 6:30 am. Mr. Behrens said that he coordinated with the local fire department to minimize environmental damage while also controlling the fire as quickly as possible by first telling the fire department to control the perimeter while he shut-in the well. By doing this, he observed that the fire in the treater went out immediately and the fire department then put water on the vessel to cool it down. A puddle of water and melted snow was observed on the SE corner of the treater berms and the snow to the south of the treater was melted. There was no oil sheen in the water puddle. It is estimated by Mr. Behrens that
approximately 1 BBL of oil or less was released both inside and outside the treater's berms combined. This amountwas also observed by Inspector Sherman. Scorched oil from the fire was spread approximately 15' to the east of the eastern treater berm and approximately 40' north of the northern treater berm, including a fine mist of oil that landed on the snow.

COGCC Field Inspector Sherman contacted Mr. Dougherty at approximately 2:02 pm on 11/25/2015 after gathering information from Vic Behrens and inspecting the location of the vertical heater treater fire at well #05-005-06345, Overland Resources LLC, Reeves 28-31, in response to his complaint on 11/25/2015. Mr. Dougherty was told that the fire was the result of a fire tube gasket malfunction in the treater and that a minimal amount of oil was released during the fire. Inspector Sherman told Mr. Dougherty that both fires that he referred to were treater fires and not vapor recovery unit/tower fires. Each fire had a different cause. Mr. Dougherty said that he appreciated this response and
the complaint could be closed.

Left message on Anadarko Response Line and also called Anadarko emergency number. Bob (don't know last name) indicated he'd send someone to check on the situation. Nov 18: noted same odor on Weld County Road 13 directly east of the drilling operation at 5:30 am on way to work, and again at home in the evening. We have smelled the odor multiple times every day since then, and have contacted Anadarko nearly every day. The odor is very strong and sometimes causes eye/throat irritation. We are concerned about what we are being exposed to, the symptoms we are experiencing, and the health effects associated with what we are being exposed to. We are concerned about the strong odor, the inability of Anadarko to fix the problem, the types of compounds we are breathing (unknown), and any adverse health effects that may be associated with them.

Odor is described as petroleum hydrocarbon and complainant indicates there is a visible component. 

Complainant has contacted Anadarko, City of Berthoud, and Weld County Health Dept.",COGCC staff were not able to confirm odor,12/30/2015,N,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Malouffs / Little Fishes operate a wildlife habitat on the east side of County Road 213, which includes a series of ponds. The wildlife habitat is down gradient from the well pad, its western border is within 300 feet of the well pad and it is hydrologically connected to the well pad. The above referenced Complaint relates to a steady leak from a dehydrator unit operated by Williams Field Services, but which services Catamount according to Doc. No. 667700699. The leak has been observed by Mr. Malouff since early June 2015, and was apparently uncontrolled for an unknown period of time. The scope of any soil contamination resulting from the leak has been masked by grading on the site. At some point, a bucket was placed by someone to catch the leakage. The bucket was removed on or about August 27, 2015, but the dehydrator continues to leak as of the date of this letter. Nothing has been done to our knowledge to evaluate and characterize the extent of resulting soil contamination on and off the pad or to repair the leak. Mr. Malouff's representative took a sample of fluid from the bucket when the bucket was in place and had the sample analyzed... A soil sample was taken from a drainage below the Catamount well pad, and up-slope of the Little Fishes Wildlife habitat in late August 2015. Methylene chloride and toluene were detected in that sample.

Also a bit unnerving since this well has blown up on us previously and they have still not reimbursed us for the lost hay they had to pick up. The operator at this location is Bayswater.

This is NE of us also and for awhile we had to tolerate the drilling, lighting, unending trucks and i even had a truck pull out right in front of me on Cty Rd 43 and 80. Then they put in some big $$ that has a huge fan pointing our direction. Terribly noisy. Now I see that they have some structure around 3 side but not the side facing us so we are getting all of the noise. It has been two years since we have been able to sleep with our windows open.

He was working on the crew that is reclaiming the pad. At 16933 Kimball Creek Road, a well pad is being reclaimed. On the evening of 10-12-15, as the heavy equipment was working, I smelled a strong benzene-like odor on the breeze that came from the direction of the well pad. I guessed they were removing contaminated soil. On the evening of 10-13-15, I spoke to some workers as they were leaving the area. One said they had encountered contaminated soil while reclaiming the pad. He said that they had dug out an area of contaminated soil large enough to park four trucks in, but they were told to bury it. I asked ""They told you to bury the contaminated soil?""He said yes. My property is just across the street from this location, and my water well is 1118 feet from the pad. There are other homes surrounding this property, some are closer than I am. I will be telling them also. This location is in a conservation easement. I will be contacting Mesa Land Trust with this information as well. I expect that this is not legal, and I would appreciate hearing from you. I was told the contaminated soil was dug from an area that could fit four trucks. It smelled like Parachute, Colorado (benzene I am guessing).

It is a low mechanical, humming to throbbing sound. It is not every night, but some nights, like last night, it is so bad we can't sleep. This is a continuous noise that gets into the head and won't let go. There is literally no room in our house that blocks the noise. Ear plugs don't work. If I put my head against a wall, the house seems to throb with the noise. We don't notice it during the day as we are at work, or the tv is on, but around 9 or 10 p.m. just when you want to get to sleep,it starts. Last night was the last straw, laying awake til 1 a.m. when finally you get so exhausted, you fall asleep. But awaking at 4 a.m., it was still going on. Our neighbors hear it too. And since it isn't every night, you can't relax and get to sleep because you are wondering ""will it start up again tonight?"" They are disturbing the peace. Please investigate last at night if possible.

Complainant was concerned that the noise is most noticeable late at night. Complainant is a resident of the Governor's Ranch neighborhood in Eaton, Colorado. Complainant has communicated with Police Department and the Eaton City Office regarding noise complaint.","Complaint #:	200437736

Nature of complaint: Noise

Field Inspector Actions:

On 10/13/2015, I was contacted by COGCC staff in reference to a noise complaint in the area of south west Eaton.  

I contacted the complainant who indicated she first experienced a humming or throbbing noise when she was out walking her dog in the neighborhood, after becoming aware of the noise she began to experience the noise in her home in the evening time, and late at night. The complainant was not sure where the noise was coming from, but believed the noise was coming from the oil and gas sites located to the south of her residence as this was the only change in the area.  

I performed site inspections of both the sites located to the south of the complainants residence which were approx ˝ to ž mile from the complainants residence. See inspection Doc# 673802602 and 673802601 for results of inspections.  I also performed sound studies at both locations, and as a result of the sound studies I found A scale issue at the Synergy site.  

I contacted Dave Pennington from Synergy, he indicated Synergy was in the process of installing a building around the compressor on location.

 
Summary: 
 At the time of the Inspection no violations of COGCC rules were found in relation to the complaint.",10/16/2015,Y,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complainant reports: Dust is on County Road 80, between Co Rd 43 and Co Rd 45. Its been dry here. The constant truck traffic creates dust- its particularly bad if you try and drive to the west late in the afternoons. The trucks make the road dusty. We have asked for mag chloride to be put down but nothing happens. The road has been torn up with minimal efforts to correct the giant dips and holes.

Field Inspector Actions:

On 10-13-2015, I was contacted by Megan Adamczyk	, from the COGCC, in reference to a series of complaints by Jamie Presgrove of Eaton.  

I contacted the complaint on 1-14-2015 and she indicated she had been dealing with several issues over the past few months all associated with the Synergy Gies location.  The complainat indicated she had been dealing with noise issues as well has dust issues from traffic on the county road, as well as an issue with sandbags which were left in the creek during the frac process.  

I performed a thorough site inspection on 10-14-2015 see inspection doc #673802599 for detail, photos and attached sound study. During the site inspection I observed sand bags in the creek where the complaint indicated they were but by the operator during the fac process. I also observed the walls placed around the compressor were not the walls commonly used to mitigate sound.  During the inspection I did not smell any odors or observe any spills at the location. I also took photos of the creek side which the complainant indicated was damaged by the high waters.


I contacted Synergy (David Pennington) and advised him of the complaints filled by the complainant.  David said he was aware of the noise complaint and of the dust complaint, but he was unaware of the sand bags left in the water.  David indicated Synergy is going to be placing a building around the compressor on location to mitigate the noise, David said he would be contacting Weld County about placing mag chloride for dust control, and we would have the sandbags in the creek bed removed.

Complainant reports: Our house is the closest residence in proximity to the drilling site. We are several hundred feet from the site. The biggest problem is NOISE at this time. For well over a year we have tried to deal with the drilling and fracking noises, bright lights and substantial increase in traffic. But now a giant compressor has been permanently installed on the site. It is very loud. We were told it is natural gas - then why are there fuel tanks beside it? Anyway, it is not quiet in any way. Every night we are kept up by the loud industrial noise filling the air. We have lived here for many years and enjoyed being able to open our windows, now we can't ever open our windows. That is not reasonable. They put a ridiculous fence around it which wasn't even close to the height of this giant compressor and not insulated, now they have put a taller fence around it but that does nothing to stop the noise. They state they are getting a building permit from the county and in about 8 weeks something will happen. The burners are the very large ones and when they burn off the sound can be very loud as well. It feels like excuses to keep making noise. Trucks are in and out 24/7 but they quiet compared to this horrible machine.Sleep deprivation is unhealthy, we are exhausted from a lack of sleep. its generally loud but we are busy during the day and it is somewhat less disturbing but it is always so intrusive that relaxing is impossible. It is particularly bad in the evenings and through the night. Sleep is near impossible until I am so exhausted I fall asleep from exhaustion. The ""walls"" built around it help to camouflage the ugly machine but don't do anything to stop the sound.

Source of noise is described as: Moving Vehicles, Compressor, giant burners

Noise is described as: Continuous, Blowing, also thumping and there have been loud bangs at times, noise you hear",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the company was fracking, they ordered water delivered via Owl Creek. This kept the creek up substantially higher than normal for many weeks. It killed all the grass along the banks of the creek leaving us with mud and lots of new weeds, and it came so fast it caused erosion. This is damage to my property and nothing was done to fix it. To insure their water made it through the culvert under the road, they put sand bags on my property near the road without my permission or even saying anything. They have never come back to remove them and now there is a stagnant pond as a result- a mosquito breeding area. They need to remove that mess as well.","

We have 2 oil fields down this road and we have semi trucks that travel at least 2 times a week to collect their product. When I first bought my property 4 yrs. ago I was told that the oil company will maintain the road because they use it. Not only do the semi trucks come down the road but there is the guy who checks and maintains the pumps that travels down the road also. He comes at least 2 times a day. They come no matter what the condition of the road is, when it rains the road is nothing but a big mud pit. There is not gravel on the road due to the traffic, and we not have ruts and huge craters in the road, but yet their turn off and around their oil pumps their is gravel and a road grader comes and maintains it, but yet it drives down the main road and does not drop it's blade to help improve the road they use to get to their oil fields. Because of the road being in such poor shape we have had 2 instances where we had to call for a ambulance and it took them 45 min. to get down our road, which is maybe a 1/4 of a mile long. My son could run faster along side the ambulance than it could drive. We pay for emergency services in our taxes and we can't even get emergency help quickly when needed. This is not right. Please help! One of the neighbors did ask the guy who maintains the pumps about maintaining the road and he said since we have been dragging a form of drag behind out vehicles, to try to level out the road, that it voids out them doing any maintenance to the road.

A leak had been identified on July 15, 2015 during a Boulder County inspection in conjunction with Anadarko. Apparently there was some miscommunication between Anadarko and Boulder County while Anadarko was notifying that they were going to be doing repairs on the leak in the near future. 
The September 9 correspondence from Boulder County to COGCC initiated a COGCC field inspection that same day, COGCC document #668200890, which found there were no audible or visual leaks at the wellhead. It was observed that there was a small audible leak at the separator and some minor maintenance was needed on the storage tank secondary containment. Boulder County was informed of the results of that inspection on September 10th.
On September 11, 2015 COGCC was notified via email that the corrective actions had been performed. On September 15, 2015 a follow up COGCC inspection, document # 668200895, showed corrective actions had been performed and it appeared that actions to repair the issues identified in July had been performed as well. 
On October 1, 2015 COGCC received complaint document # 200437653 from Boulder County Inspector Patrick Murphy. In this complaint the timeline for the original leak identification was given.
On October 2, 2015 a third COGCC inspection, document #674102627, was performed including an optical gas imagining survey. There was no indication of a leak during that inspection.

The letter was cc'd to Pioneer local staff (including superintendent, an engineer, and a foreman) and 4 other landowners in Rancho La Garita. Owner did not provide a local address but indicated their home is on Lot 53 in Rancho La Garita, Trinidad, Colorado. 

Summary of key information from letter: 

Well is approximately 650 yards from our home, it sits on a ridge at the same elevation where practically nothing blocks its noise.  When first installed about six years ago, neighbors in closer proximity complained about the noise of this well resulting in the construction of a sound enclosure and placement of a large water tank on its east side to help block the noise.  Occasionally a faint engine noise would drift across the canyon to our house however we never considered it a problem. 

In June of this year, 2015, an entirely different and much louder sound was heard coming from ALABASTER which is the only engine-driven, vertical-piston well pump within a mile radius (all others have rotary pumps).  The engine noise is unusual because of its higher-pitched shrill sound plus a continuous fluctuating RPM (between 1,700 and 2,000 rpm) at 10 second intervals.  The constant loud revving makes it impossible to ever get used to the sound and Alabaster is considerably louder than any well in the area.  It is audible at our home at least 50% of the time depending on wind & weather conditions and our neighbor Bert Nale, Lot 69, occasionally hears it even though hes a mile away.

Complainant provided a history of communication and proposed resolution with Pioneer. Communication ranged from June 21, 2015 through September 27, 2015. Communication involved the discussion of 6 proposed resolutions, which complainant believed have not been implemented or have been inadequate for addressing noise complaints. Complainant plans to depart for California shortly. Complainant documentation will be attached to final form.

Conoco Phillips
Hearing Protest Rule 509 question
Our mineral interest was in Leasehold with Conoco Phillips in this drilling unit. Upon lease expiration Conoco Phillips refused to honor the terms of extension. These terms were clearly negotiated, written and recorded. Conoco offered a fraction of the negotiated amount and refused to honor our extension. Conoco Phillips' position was a default that they would simply force pool us if we didn't accept the lower offer. I understand and agree with the rule and spirit of forced pooling. When folks are loggerheads, a system as such is valuable and fair. I also believe forced pooling threat in negotiation is reasonable when a lease is not existent and without extension terms. My complaint is that Conoco Phillips is using forced pooling unfairly; as a default strategy to negotiate a better deal. Conoco Phillips is abusing this needed system to put themselves in a superior financial place and at the expense of the small mineral owner. In principle, we refused Conoco Phillips abuse of the forced pooling system and didn't accept ConocoPhillips' offer. We plead to the commission for accountability and ethical practice by Conoco Phillips. We wish nothing more than Conoco Phillips to honor their agreement. We appeal to the COGCC to shine some light and accountability on Conoco Phillips' abuse of the forced pooling system.",I contacted Ron to address what can be done if there is a lease expiration prior to the statutory pooling.

I became aware of an odor that I've never smelled before. Sort of pungent. Sort of sweet. Sort of sour. An odor like sour gas. The windows in my house were open. As I closed the windows I started to sneeze uncontrollably. Once the windows were closed the odor subsided. My husband Tod said he couldn't smell anything because whatever the odor was it caused his sinuses to fill up and he couldn't smell anything. His nose was stuffed up. And the joints in his body ached. At 7:00 a.m. Tod rode his bike to work at his office 5 blocks from our house in Silt. He reported back to me that the air was definitely bad because his upper respiratory symptoms worsened on the ride to his office, and he had a metallic taste in his mouth. He said whatever it was permeated the air from our house to his office on Main Street. I was sick all day Wednesday.
I have never smelled an odor like this before. I had a severe reaction to it including upper respiratory distress, gastrointestinal distress, headache, joint pain, swollen glands, earache.
John Doose of Ursa Resources called me at about 8:00 a.m. because Kirby Wynn (Garfield County O&G liaison) had contacted him with my complaint. I had sent an email about the odor to Kirby shortly after 7:00 a.m. John Doose asked me if I could tell where the odor was coming from. I told him what Tod had told me, that it permeated the air from our house to Main Street, and that we could not tell where it was coming from. I told him I had just been outside with my dogs and I could still smell wafts of the odor in the air.","Staff conducted inspections of location around Silt,co no  Violations found.",10/9/2015,N,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

API # 05-123-39630. The well is drilled under 270 acres of property we leased to Great Western Leasing, LLC, in Section 16 T6N R67W.
,From what we have been told, sales from production first occurred a year ago, in August 2014. We did not receive any royalties in 2014, and answers to our inquiries were vague. We felt that we were being put off and that we would not get answers or payments unless we threatened enforcement action. After confirming with the COGCC and other royalty owners that sales had occurred, we send a letter to Great Western stating that we would proceed with a Commission complaint under CRS 38-60-118.5 unless payment was received. In response to our letter, we received payment of the royalties that had been held back, and then began receiving monthly payments. We did not receive royalties this month (for June 2015 production), and investigated. We were told that Great Western has recently agreed with a third party claimant (the holder of deeds of trust against a portion of our property) to place all of our royalties in suspense. We have confirmed that other royalty owners were paid for June 2015 production from this well. There is no question that royalties are payable from June 2015 production. Great Western justifies the withholding of royalties from the encumbered acreage under CRS 38-60-118.5(3)(a)(III)--""litigation that would affect the distribution of payments to a payee"". However, there is no such litigation. We have been sued for payment by the third party claimant, but there is no litigation involving Great Western, and no claims in the pending litigation that would affect the distribution of payments to us. Great Western has not offered any excuse for withholding the royalties earned from the unencumbered acreage; instead, it has used the third party claimant's claims as an excuse to refuse to pay any royalties to Lot Holding. Royalties derived from our entire mineral acreage have been placed in suspense, even though no more than half of our mineral acreage is encumbered by the claims of the third party claimant. The acreage is subdivided, and it is simple to calculate which parcels are encumbered, which are unencumbered, and to compute the acreage in each category. But Great Western has withheld our entire royalty payment--the portion due under the encumbered acreage, and the portion due under the unencumbered acreage. Even if Great Western were justified in withholding royalties from the encumbered acreage (they aren't), Great Western has no justification for withholding the royalties from the unencumbered acreage.",Directed the complainant to the Form 37 process,9/1/2015,Y,N,,N,,N,,12339630.0,05-123-39630,123.0,Weld,16-022HC,DeTienne FD,,f,f,f,t,437638.0,429507.0,DeTienne FD Pad 10-202HN,PR,2014-07-10,10110.0,GREAT WESTERN OPERATING COMPANY LLC,90750.0,WATTENBERG,4836.4,-104.886808,40.499319,509591.0,4483190.0,10.0,6N,67W,NWSW,6,1894.0,S,580.0,W,PLANNED LatLong,t,t,f,f,f,f,t,t,2014-08-12,2014-08-15,2014-09-15,f,31.0,f,http://cogcc.state.co.us/cogis/FacilityDetail.asp?facid=12339630&type=WELL,2017-02-24 11:00:00,2017-02-24 11:00:00,f

I experience lethargy, severe chest pain to the point of being hospitalized, confusion, and extreme emotional distress because no one has helped me and few people understand that natural gas is odorless.
,Chest pain resulting in multiple hospital visits causing me to vacate the building in fear of adverse health effects. Prevailing wind direction, proximity, and topography is preventing adequate dissipation. There is yellow spray paint and tape all over the glycol dehydrator. BP's told me the emissions are 'organic' and not to worry. They installed a canister upwind of the Christmas Tree. They have refused to comment regarding my safety and potential exposure. In order to protect my safety I have been forced to evacuate the building and only return to get things stored in building briefly. The issue has caused me to cease my regular operations in the building.
I have contacted the EPA, the Treasurer of Colorado, my local US Senator, The president of the United States, the NRO, NASA and a few others. No one has helped so far and I was waiting to file my complaint with the COGCC in hopes BP would act reasonably and follow its own corporate code. I did not understand what the COGCC was until recently and assumed they would not be any more helpful. I was wrong I hope.","COGCC conducted inspection of well and equipment, including a infrared survey using a FLIR 320 gasfinder camera on 8/26/15. No gas was observed other than intermittent releases from the pneumatic controller. Field inspection supervisor issued an inspection (doc#667700689) with the infrared footage attached and asked operator to confirm that vertical separator and valves were functioning properly and within manufacturers specifications. Operator confirmed this in addition to confirming that the pneumatics were compliant with CDPHE air regulations and that the domestic tap and associated mercaptan system once used on property have been completely disconnected and removed. At request of complainant, staff conducted an additional infrared survey on 9/25/15 focusing on areas around location and above pipeline and around and in metal building to look for any possible leaks from buried lines, no gas was detected during this survey and a satisfactory inspection was issues (doc#667700697).

The recent conversion of the gas compressors to electric motors has significantly raised the DB/noise level of the plant. The plant regularly exceeds the mandated 50 DB at 350 feet from the centerline of the pipeline by 10 - 20%. Not only is it substantially louder but the sound is much more piercing. I live in a log home about 1750 lf away. I can hear the sound indoors through the 18"" logs. My neighbor Holly who is 730 feet away lives in a poured concrete house. She wears earplugs indoors, in the evenings, and still cant escape the noise. The plant is much louder in the winter months when I assume demand for the product being pumped is higher. But it still exceeds the DB requirements all other times of the year. That plant is typically loudest in the evenings and early mornings.  The new sound produced from this plant makes being outdoors unbearable at times. One neighbor cant hold a conversation outdoors, and must sleep with his windows there closed even on hot nights. I recently had a friend visiting in the afternoon and he asked, ""whats that sound, I feel like my head is going to explode"". We as a group are very frustrated that the pipeline company spent millions of dollars to upgrade there facility and did not spend one dime on sound mitigation. Our research has shown that sound control measures could have been easily implemented into the overall construction project for a relatively minimal cost. We first contacted the pipeline company in January and it is now apparent that they have no consideration for the well being and health of there neighbors.","The station is one of many compressors along a Mid-America Pipeline Company (MAPCO) pipeline that runs from Wyoming through Utah, Colorado and New Mexico.

I experienced difficulty breathing (pain in my chest) while at my home at 7672 CR CC, Pleasant View, which was in direct line with the wind blowing from the compressor station a mile away.  My difficulty breathing declined when I drove away from the area, and was gone within 4 hours.  As far as I can tell, there are no residual problems.
I contacted Kinder Morgan CO2 Company at their regular phone number 882-2464 and their emergency number 882-5522 and was assured that I was in no danger, but the man I was talking to also said that perhaps it was caused by someone else and that the Kinder Morgan employees were also in danger.  Clearly he didn't have a clue.  Messages left on my recorder later repeated that I was in no danger.  This indicates that, after persuing the matter, they determined that Kinder Morgan did have a gas release.  Otherwise, the message surely would have been ""it isn't us.""
Is there any regulation requiring this sort of incident to be reported to you?  If so, how do I get a copy?  If not, I am requesting you investigate it.  What will be done to see that this doesn't happen again?","After many visits to the area, inspectors were not able to confirm conditions described in complaint.

Nature of complaint: Noise/Permitting

Field Inspector Actions:

 On 7/23/2015 I was contacted by Jeff Rickard of the COGCC in reference to a complaint of noise and possible permitting issue dealing with setback rules.  

I called and spoke with the complaint who said he was experiencing noise coming from the battery site which he believed was not in compliance with the COGCC rules.  The complainant indicated his main concern was the building of new wells at the location which he believed would cause the noise levels to increase above what the sound levels were now. The complaint believed the new setback rules should be applied to the new wells at the location as the old permits had expired.

I performed a site inspection and conducted a noise study at the location. See inspection Doc# 673802357 for attached sound study results.


I advised the complainant to contact Barbra Westerdaleof with the COGCC permitting concerning his questions involving the new wells at the location.

It was noticeably darker than what was coming out of any of the other towers. I appreciate your staff going to the site to look into the issue, but recognize that this did not occur for almost five days, giving the operator ample time to find a way to respond to the claim before your staff arrived to look into it. Even so, I was hopeful that the issue had been corrected. Today, while I was down in Mead, I decided to drive by the location along the frontage road and see if the company had actually fixed the problem. I did not drive onto the location or exit my vehicle, but merely lowered my window and observed while I parked along the frontage road. While the obvious dark color that I saw last week was no longer coming out of the easternmost tower, several of the towers appear to be emitting something greasy. It does not seem to be just related to heat, as whatever is coming out of the towers is visible beyond the stacks and not dependent on the wind (winds were calm while I observed this). While I was parked along the frontage road and observing the greasy fumes coming from several of the stacks, I noticed a chemical-like smell. I have never smelled this odor before. Additionally, while I was only parked near the towers for 5-10 minutes, I began to feel light-headed and nauseous. That is actually what led me to leave so quickly and immediately contact your office. Is your office equipped with one of those special cameras that can detect dangerous emissions that are not easily seen with the naked eye? I apologize that I do not remember what it is called. However, if you have the technology, I hope that you would consider revisiting the location and using that camera to see what exactly is being released from those stacks. There are so many homes nearby and people drive so closely to the location, that it makes quite worried.","The COGCC performed an inspection on this location 7/20/2015 for the same reason and did not find any issues.

 On 7/23/2015 I was contacted by Jeff Rickard of the COGCC in reference to a complaint of noise and dust mitigation and access restrictions at the Troudt Extraction location.  


I went to the location and performed a site inspection see Doc# 673802354 for details of inspection and photos.  Upon arrival at the location I observed the site was currently in the process of installing 30 sound walls on the west end of location and the operator was in the process of drilling conductor pipe on location.  I observed a farmer to the north of the location tilling his field which appeared to be causing dust from the west of the location but I did not observe any dust coming from the location.  (See Attached photos)

 

 


 I spoke to Jose Torres from Extraction on location and advised him of the issues raised by the complainant.  Jose said Extraction was in the process of installing the sound walls and as far as he was aware all the traffic to and from the location 
were being routed to the north on county road 17.   Extraction indicated they would install sign to control the traffic and they would be bringing in a water truck to control any possible dust mitigation.

I performed sound study approx 350 to the east of location. See inspection Doc# 673802354 for results of sound study.

The traffic issues raised by the complainant as well as the dust mitigation issues were turned over to weld county representative Troy Swain.

Nature of complaint: Noise

Field Inspector Actions:

 On 7-20-2015, I was contacted by COGCC supervisor Jim Precup in reference to a noise complaint received over the weekend. In the complaint the complainant indicated the noise coming from the Ward Riverdale location had increased over the weekend.  The complainant said she noticed increased activity at the location Friday evening and the noise level increased as well.

I contacted the complaint on 7-20-2015, the complainant said she noticed increased activity at the location Friday evening and the noise level increased as well at that time and over the weekend.  The complainant said she believed the operator increase the activity and the noise because they would not be inspected until the complaint was addressed on Monday or Tuesday as she was unable to contact COGCC staff.  The complainant said the noise had subsided as of Sunday and she was not experiencing the noise at the time of our conversation.

I performed a inspection of the location and spoke to Ward Petroleum personnel, they indicated they had been in flowback on the location but on Saturday they had switched over to production.  The increased activity on location was during the switch over process.  I inspected the separator and vapor recovery unit on location which were running at the time of inspection(see attached photo) both pieces of equipment were behind an approx 6 dirt berm on the north end of location as well as an additional larger dirt berm located on the north side of the location. See Inspection Doc# 673802317 for results of inspection and attached photos.

Nature of complaint: Noise

Field Inspector Actions:

 On 7-20-2015, I was contacted by COGCC supervisor Jim Precup in reference to a noise complaint received over the weekend. In the complaint the complainant indicated the noise coming from the Ward Riverdale location had increased over the weekend.  The complainant said she noticed increased activity at the location Friday evening and the noise level increased as well.

I contacted the complaint on 7-20-2015, the complainant said she noticed increased activity at the location Friday evening and the noise level increased as well at that time and over the weekend.  The complainant said she believed the operator increase the activity and the noise because they would not be inspected until the complaint was addressed on Monday or Tuesday as she was unable to contact COGCC staff.  The complainant said the noise had subsided as of Sunday and she was not experiencing the noise at the time of our conversation.

I performed a inspection of the location and spoke to Ward Petroleum personnel, they indicated they had been in flowback on the location but on Saturday they had switched over to production.  The increased activity on location was during the switch over process.  I inspected the separator and vapor recovery unit on location which were running at the time of inspection(see attached photo) both pieces of equipment were behind an approx 6 dirt berm on the north end of location as well as an additional larger dirt berm located on the north side of the location. See Inspection Doc# 673802317 for results of inspection and attached photos.

I dont recall the name of the station but it is located next to an EOG Resources supply yard


This email to serve as my complaint about the Hereford Gas Compressor station located in Hereford, CO. This station, since it went online about a year ago frequently flares gas at a high rate. The flame can be seen at least 8 miles away (from my bedroom window) and occurs for 10 minutes to days at a time. Similar stations that I have seen only flare for a short time (minutes, if that) however this station routinely produces flames around 35ft or in height, or larger. Essentially it looks like a flame thrower at my location.

In addition to the constant flaring, there is excessive amount of lightning at this station which disrupts the night sky, carries for many miles and is a visual nuisance. In fact, driving home north out of Briggsdale on Weld County Road 77, the station could be seen literally 20 miles away at night (I check the GPS and vehicle odometer as I didnt think that could be it  but it was).

During nights with high moisture or low clouds, the problem is even worse as the light reflects off the clouds then add the flaring and it is very intolerable.

Enclosed are the best pics I was able to take, and I am working on clearer/more defined ones. Similar stations in the area do not flare anywhere near the amount this one does, and is not lit up like the Rockies Stadium at night.


Any help would be great, and Id like to have my contact information removed from the public record.


What I would like to see is lightning reduced or changed to be more directional, so that it is not creating a visual nuisance in the area. Reducing flood lights and putting in directional and/or LED lights should easily resolve this. For the flaring an inspection or routine spot checks I think would help keep this in check. Local power companies and others who know more about the facility than I do have stated in passing that it well beyond its rated capacity and the flaring that the neighboring towns and property owners see on a daily basis is the result of it.",The complainant has the ability to interface directly with a representative of Summit midstream to discuss perceived problems as they occur.,8/6/2015,N,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the disparity in the lease offers, I told them we (my wife and I) would rather be force pooled, but we would not need to be ""forced"" because we would agree to be 2.2% working interest owners with the 12.5% royalty until our portion of the well is paid off.

While pressure testing the discharge line from Miller Compressor Station a leak was discovered in the line. While hydro-excavating around the meter, under the assumption that the discharge line was leaking, impacted soil was discovered, along with an unmarked 3"" fiberglass line. Natural gas vapors were being emitted from the sidewall of the excavation, even after Miller Compressor Station was shut down. In order to assess the extent of the impacted soil, the meter was removed on 7/1/15. With the meter removed KMGG can not operate Miller Compressor Station. After contacting oil and gas operators in the area, Texas Tea of Colorado (TTOC) agreed to turn on the Pace #2 well to see if the 3"" fiberglass line was theirs, and to confirm it was leaking. On 7/3/15 TTOC turned on the Pace #2 well, there was visual confirmation by KMGG and COGCC officials that the flowline was in fact leaking. Having Miller Compressor Station shut down has taken approximately 1.3 to 1.6 mmcf/day of natural gas off line. KMGG is obligated to gather this natural gas for Encana Corporation. KMGG has incurred damages from lost production related to this matter.
It is evident that there are soil impacts and a definite possibility there are groundwater impacts associated with this release. TTOC does not appear to be interested in removing the impacted soil or conducting groundwater remediation associated with this release.","It was determined that a release had occurred from the Texas Tea, Pace #2 flowline at the Miller Compressor Station.  COGCC required that Texas Tea properly report and remediate the release.  Texas Tea did not agree that impacts at the location were attributable to the flowline release.  As a result, COGCC issued NOAV #200437494 to Texas Tea on 09/28/2015 requiring corrective actions to properly delineate and remediate impacts to soil and groundwater at the site.",9/29/2015,Y,Y,200437494.0,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the time that I made my investments, I spoke with several representatives, however I mainly corresponded with Steve Ziemke, Vice President of Heartland Energy, Inc., hereinafter, (HEI). During our conversations, offerings of various oil and gas partnerships were supported by geologist reports and promises of lucrative revenue potential based on low risk investment with high return. Along with tax incentives, I was convinced to invest. As an investor, I was never informed that HEI was owned and operated by Charles Reed Cagle who, while operating several other companies, solicited the same type of investments. Mr. Cagle has been found guilty by at least two state commissioners regarding these types of investments. In fact, fraud was proven on at least one occasion by the state of Colorado which ordered a Complaint for Injunction. Your company and its owner/operator has already been found in violation of several civil laws that govern the business of these investments. Furthermore, all of the offering information I was supplied with was materially misrepresented solely for the purpose of convincing me to invest. Please note that at the time of my investment, I was over 65 years of age. As you can see, I am displeased with the way my investment has been handled and your companys lack of interest in righting the wrongs that have taken place. As I have given your company adequate time to provide returns on my investment, the lack of progress is unfortunate but not an excuse.

Field Inspector Actions:

On 7/2/2015, I was contacted by COGCC staff in reference to a Noise/Lighting complaint coming from the a location near the southeast corner of Hwy 257 and County Road 78.  I contacted the complainant who indicated to me the noise he was experiencing was coming from a large silver colored incinerator he also indicated the lights on location were disruptive to him in the evening time.

Upon arriving at location I determined the site was the Nelson Farm Extraction location.   I observed three portable light plants on location, none of the portable light plants were operational at the time of the inspection. All three of the portable light plants on the location had the lights directed toward the center of the location and pointed toward the ground.  I observed the portable light plant located on the NW corner of the location was facing SE.  I contacted Extraction staff and they repositioned the portable light plant to the SW corner to avoid any possible lighting issues.

Nature of complaint: Odor

Field Inspector Actions:

On 6-19-2015 I was contacted by COGCC staff in reference to an odor complaint coming from the C street Extraction location.  Upon arriving at location I spoke with the lease operator on location.  The lease operator said the reason for the odor complaint on 6-18-2015 was the location was shut down while they attempted to install new compressor at the site.  The release was caused by high line pressure and maintenance to equipment on location.  A inspection of the site was conducted and a thermal image video of the site was conducted see Doc#673802236 for results.

The complainant said every day and night at different times of the day and night they could hear a very loud, screeching, clanging, noise coming from the location.

I advised the complaint I would perform a site inspection and as PDC had already installed sound walls and installed sound curtains around the rig floor and shakers on the rig I would request a sound study be conduct so we could possibly pin point the noise in an attempt to identify the noise and correct the issues the complainant was hearing.

I contacted PDC and they installed a sound study approx 350 from the sound walls in the direction of the complainants home.

As well, the commission is not addressing sound science by failing to address and publicly acknowledge that fracking activities are causing earthquakes, that Cotter documents from 2 decades ago that the state maintains as an Agreement State with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, indicate magnitude 5 and greater earthquakes have been recorded in Southern Colorado for decades, prior to the modern day fracking industry dominating any and every space they could, and with the higher earthquake risk now associated with fracking through sound science, and state and federal laws which require proper disclosure to the public when a ""normal"" activity carries a higher risk of a dangerous outcome, why none of the people who are charged with upholding public interest and the health and well-being of the public per their job descriptions as public servants, are raising hell when decisions like these are being made? Because of this poor decision and lack of oversight, obviously, I posed the same questions to the Bureau of Prisons, and their parent, the Department of Justice in the last week to try and figure out what in the hell is going on in Colorado since apparently it's not a big deal to possibly cause an earthquake by a federal prison with the worlds most dangerous terrorists inside. That the lack of oversight here is mind blowing to say the least, and begs the question of the legitimatcy in the regulatory authority for the State of Colorado at this time.  See above. Also see Tischa Schuller and Robert Frick bio's as it concerns their roles for the nuclear materials industry, and what appears to be several significant conflicts of interest in Fremont, Weld and Larimer Counties.",No site specific information nor no specific issue identified in the complaint that would allow the COGCC to investigate.

As far as the records of the COGCC show, the well could be open from below whatever surface casing may have been installed, to TD, listed as 10,100 ft. According to recent correspondence from Bob Koehler of your office, the permit has recently been pulled for this well. The failure of Select Energy to properly complete this facility has put the interests of petroleum lease holders in the area at risk by exposing petroleum reservoirs, non-producing intervals, and possibly shallow aquifers, to contamination by the native formation water or petroleum resources from the Cretaceous section, including the Niobrara formation. In addition, I believe that there is the potential of contamination from injected oil field wastes from the neighboring injection well operated by Expedition Water Solutions, EWS no. 1 (API 05-123-39770).

From April 2014 through November 2014 Summit Midstream (as a contractor for Black Hills Plateau Production and the controlling entity of Red Rock Gathering Company, LLC) negotiated with the Sharon family (owners of the property) for a 1 (originally 5) year easement ""limited only to traversing the road for purposes of operational and maintenance inspection of the pipeline(s) on neighboring lands as may be necessary. The pipeline referenced services the nearby Debeque Station Water Facility/Debeque Processing Plant. Access was to be limited to light pick-up trucks, van-sized utility vehicles, and Utility Task Vehicles (UTVs) only. During this negotiating period, Summit Midstream contractors and employees repeatedly entered the Sharon property without owners knowledge or permission. Contrary to owners strict instructions, Summit also brought heavy construction equipment onto the property and, without owners knowledge or permission, removed an existing culvert and replaced it with a larger culvert and altered the footprint of existing two-track dirt road in order to accommodate their own construction timing constraints and, presumably, to make it easier for Summits own vehicles to traverse the property for the desired purpose of operational and maintenance inspection of the pipeline. Sharons subsequently learned that Summit employees or agents performed a survey of the road without consent and without providing the notice required under C.R.S. § 18-4-515(2).",This was not a operator issue.

The gases were under pressure and we received a large amount of strong smelling gases upon us while we were working outside. Since the leaking hatch was replaced, KPK employees have been opening the hatches each morning. This was not a common practice until just recently. Before we used to receive gases from their site when the tank pressure built up and the release valves released the pollution, now we receive the gases when a KPK employee manually releases them upon us.
 
My family again is demanding the shut down of this site. It is a health and safety risk to my family. This is the third release upon us since the Colorado Oil and Gas Commission granted the expansion of this site.

Field Inspector Actions:
 On 5-13-2015 I was contacted by Jim Precup of the COGCC in reference to a noise and odor complaint coming from the Ward Riverdale location. 
Upon arriving at the location I observed Extreme rig 18 on location performing drilling operation I performed a site inspection of the location see doc#  for details of inspection.
I attempted to perform a sound study on 5-13-2015 but due to high winds above 5 mph I was unable to perform a sound study.

Heard not felt. from Pump engine & water ring. continous noise. also a truck engine noise 24/7.


Noise @ the Dude Well site: The well site originally wasn't too bad. The pump on the Dude Well site used to use a 6 cylinder, 300 horsepower engine. 2+ years ago Pioneer Natural Resource (PNR) added a ""water ring"" (or so I'm told, not sure if that's the proper name for it) to the well site. The water ring uses a V8 (8 cylinder engine), 350 horsepower engine. Obviously the bigger engine is noisier. After a year and a half addressing this issue with PNR, they put up a sound wall up. The sound wall is basically a Pro-panel (metal) wall. It's supposed to have some sort of insulation to cut back the noise. The sound wall on the Dude Well site is missing quite a bit of its installation. PNR told me that they would put hospital grade mufflers on the bigger engine. This has not happened yet. At night the well site seems to get louder (I'm assuming that @ night the air up here in the mountain is liter, so it makes the sound carry easier & loader).

For the most part it is. Morning are very load. Day & afternoon the noise isn't too bad, but @ night it gets really load","On June 5,2015 at 3:00pm I called Mr. Adams and shared the noise data I had collected.

The analytical results showed detections of DRO, GRO, BTEX and the dissolved gases of methane (19 mg/L), ethane (380 ug/L) and propane (85 ug/L).

These wells are located on the rim of a canyon between our property and the State School property. We started addressing the issue with Chris Sanchez of Pioneer Natural Resources and he agreed the wells were to loud but nothing was ever done to abate the noise. The POA of which I am currently President attempted to address these noisy well sites with Betty Brownson of PNR. She stated that they would only address wells within our POA and would not do anything about wells on State School property because they didn't have to. We had or Attorney address this issue along with other issues that we had with Pioneer and their Attorney told us "" Well noise is regulated by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission "". Pioneer has come back and put sound proofing enclosures around several well sites within our POA, but refuses to address these noisy well sites that are directly across the canyon from my cabin because they are on State property. These wells are run with gas engines that have their exhausts pointed towards my property and are always noisy. The noise echoes across the canyon and you can easily see these well sites from my cabin. There are several wells in the near area, but I only have the names of these 3 at this time.

I have attached 3 photos of the same oil spill. I measured the entire area that was wet at the time. It was basically 15 feet x 5 feet.  At first we believed that this was an oil spill from the recent work that KPK did on the well located in the middle of our property as we had several other similar oil spills from that work. (I will be filing a separate complaint on that matter with pictures later today)
 
Since there is a cone shaped hole where the oil started, I believe that the oil is coming from underground. As the previous oil spills on our property were dealt with by covering them up with dirt, I am insisting that this area is not disturbed without me on site. Please call me immediately regarding this issue and confirm that this is a valid complaint accepted by the COGCC.

Marc Morton, P.G. was on our property with Amanda (Anne) Harper. I asked first who they are, then asked if they knew they were trespassing. Mr. Morton said he is not trespassing, he has a right to be on any oil/gas well site in the state of Colorado anytime he wants. I asked how he has a right to invite Ms. Harper onto our property. He said he invited no one. I asked how she has a right to invite him on and he repeated that he can go wherever he wants on gas/oil sites. I asked why he brought her onto our property because we do not want her here and he said he is inspecting a well site and then he showed me that he had permitting papers. I told him I am very happy with EnCana and how respectful and kind they have always been with us and that I want them to go ahead with the drilling. He told me that he was there only to inspect the well site. Does Mr. Morton have a right to come onto our property at any time without our permission, and does he have a right to bring onto our property someone who we absolutely do not want on our property?",The Director discussed this issue with staff to reinforce that COGCC staff are not allowed to take private citizens  on oil and gas locations without prior approval.

 Also, I am not sure how they can be drilling this without any surface or mineral right agreement with the CPW as I know the oil and gas pocket extends underneath our property, just west and south of the main shop and residence area.
  Has there been another contract set or taken care of? Or is the future driller looking at trying to have a blanket drill underneath the existing oil and gas contract, under the directional drills from the Neuman property?

We are extremely concerned about the noise level when they begin to drill. Last night, our sleep was disturbed by just the motors of the machines that they have going now. The drilling has not even begun. In addition, this project will be going for most of the summer, if not all of it. We sleep with our windows open in the summer, for many reasons, primarly to keep our electric bill managable. Even with improved sound walls this will not be possible.

We've worked with Encana (and they have been very friendly) to get a noise study done and I've obtained a copy of the report (nowhere to attach in this form) which shows the low frequency C-weighted levels were consistently above the limit of 65 dbc, and in fact, rarely fell below the limit. And this is at a distance of over 1500 feet! That operation has since stopped fracking, but the 2 to the far west part of the plot have been just as bad, if not worse. It seems they are running at the same time, which makes it even worse. I understand noise is to be made, but what we've experienced is just not right.

The northern-most well has been continuously burning off gas for several days. I noticed odors over the weekend into monday. I find it quite surprising that our State regulatory agency would allow an industry to have such a large open flame burning for so long. It is disappointing to me that the industry is allowed to irresponsibly burn off,and in effect, waste such vast amounts of a natural resource. A resource that future generations may find themselves in dire need of. The oil and gas industry is clearly not prepared to efficiently harvest minerals. COGCC is not following it's declared Mission - to promote efficient production of oil and gas in a manner consistent with the protection of public health, safety and welfare. COGCC is also not following its mission of preventing waste. Come to this area any night and you will see abundant wasting of one of our natural resources - flames can be viewed from this high vantage point all over the Poudre River valley. COGCC must act swiftly to prove its relevance in this state. I don't believe the citizens will allow this for much longer.

I've called COGCC a few times on this well in the past. Jason Gomez has come out and inspected and filed reports and always lets me know his findings. I appreciate his diligence.

Its Great Western Oil and Gas - I have not contacted them. But its really not just GWOG. For some reason our State has allowed over 22,000 wells to be active in Weld County......most wells are known to leak methane and other gasses. How can that happen? How can so many wells in that one area get permitted? I look to the east and almost every day there is a brown cloud hanging over the county. It is very sad indeed.","Complaint #:	 200423541

Nature of complaint: Odor

Field Inspector Actions:
On 1-29-2015 I observed a flare operating at the Raindance location.  I went to the location and performed a site inspection and recorded a 2 minute thermal imagery of the location.  During my thermal imagery of the location I observed what appeared to be VOC venting out of the frac tanks located on the North end of the location.  See inspection Doc# 673801732 for results of Inspection and thermal imagery of location.

After performing the site inspection I was contacted by Dale Agan in reference to a complaint of odor coming from the Raindance location.  I advised Mr. Agan I had performed a site inspection of the Raindance location and I advised him I would be forwarding my inspection to the CDPHE on reference to his odor complaint.  I advised Mr. Agan to formally file a complaint if he with our complaint line of the COGCC.

I was later informed by the COGCC complaint department of the formal complaint filed by Mr. Agan, the complainant had indicated the odors he was smelling at his residence were possibly coming from one or all of the sites located east of his residence.  As a result I performed site inspection at the Pasvitma location and the Frye Farms locations.  See Doc# 673801741 and Doc# 673801740 and Doc#373801743 for details of inspections and thermal imagery of the locations.

*Aditional Comments*
I am unsure when exactly the noise started. As Colorado law provides that drilling can go on even without consent of those affected, I did not think that I could protest the noise, possible air pollution, dust, etc. In addition, I have read in the paper that even after you determine the decibel level has been exceeded, you do not enforce the law.

After another sleepless night listening to the roar of fracking compressors and the day-lighting by un-screened light towers, I wanted to let you both know your efforts to reach compromise with landowners continues to be thwarted by James Precup. 

By now you should be aware operator Renegade Oil and Gas has failed to complete (15 month old) required improvements\construction including an access road from WCR 4 to the Neickien Well located on my property. Please read the entire agreement not the cherry picked sentence forwarded by Mr. Condill. What had been a 2 track farm access across a producing Alfalfa field is now muddy quagmire.. To add insult to this injury\damage is purported necessary to monitor the fracking impact on gas pressure at the long shut in Neickien well. 

In what I'm sure will be characterized by operators and some staff as a ""uncooperative landowner"" I once again grudgingly opened my gate\property to another assault by Oil and Gas Operators overseen by the COGCC. What would be a much appreciated surprise would be an acknowledgment from the COGCC.

Ed Dumph","Inspectors went to both the Strawder #1 and Neckien #1 wells on February 10, 2015 to inspect related to the issues in the complaint.  Regarding the Neckien well, the access road was in good shape but the pad needed to be treated for weeds and the tanks needed to be painted.  However, Operator access to the location has been denied by the land owner.  Once access is granted these issues need to be corrected.  Regarding the Strawder well, no issues from the complaint were identified in the inspection.

Two banks of lights immediately above the dog house were directed towards the complainant residence.  Upon informing the operators of the offending lights they were deemed to be unnecessary and disconnected while inspector was on location.
The site had noise mitigation walls installed on the East and South side of the drilling location. The complainants residence is located to the Southwest of the location.
During the site inspection the operator indicated that they had concluded their drilling activities at 3:00 AM January 16, 2015 and were in the process of preparing the rig for transport away from the location. Inspector questioned operator concerning horns sounds. The operator indicated that they were not operating any horns as a part of the drilling process. They potulated that the required backup beeper on a front-end loader may have been the offending periodic horn sound.
A detailed inspection of the rig was performs and no problems were identified. Chemicals associated with drilling operations have been removed from location. Crew was preparing the top-drive unit for transport from the location.

debris which allowed the mud from location to be transferred to WCR 13. Upon entering the site I observed noise

The noise levels exceed the regulations. This noise is causing heaqlth and mental damage to all the residents in structures within 1 mile of the facility. This has been ongoing over the last few years. Especially after the expansion in the last couple years. The noise should be mitigated to reduce it as much as possible below maximum levels as a gesture of good will to the community. Only meeting regulations will no longer be the acceptable norm in this area. We expect and deserve better treatment from Anadarko. Anadarko should not shift the burden of proof on the State of Colorado(due to timing issues) causing noise readings to not be taken when the compressors are operating at maximum capacity. If possible, Anadarko should cooperate in operating at maximum levels upon the request from the people of the State of Colorado when testing can be done at the people's convenience. The burden of compliance at all times and level of operations should be on Anadarko.Their cooperation in this matter is critical in continuing to be able to develop natural gas in Weld County and the State of Colorado.",Inspection on 5/14/2014 found sound levels to be compliant.

The flowing water was first noted on July 7, 2013, by a surface owner and adjacent surface owner. The location is in the general vicinity of the the DeBeque project where the COGCC is in the process of PA of some old oil and gas wells. COGCC has contacted the surface owner representative, Kenneth Bowels (surface owner is out of contact for a couple of weeks). Mr. Bowels stated that he estimated the flow to be about 20 gpm, (4-inch wide by one -inch in depth) flowing to a irrigation waster water ditch and into Roan Creek which ultimately flows to the Colorado River. Mr. Bowels stated that the water was clear and the flow has not increased much since July 7, 2013. COGCC has contacted the Walter Group who will be on site on July 10, 2013, to aid in assessing the situation, in addition to collecting samples for laboratory analysis to determine if this is oil and gas related. COGCC verbally notified Ann Nedrow Daytime Coordinator, Emergency and Incident Reporting Line Office of Emergency Preparedness and Response with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and appraised CDPHE of the situation. Spill Report Number 2013-0432. COGCC will be onsite by July 10, 2013 to make a general assessment of the situation. Alex Fischer and Carlos Lujan went to the site and using a metal detector identified metal where water was flowing from the ground, suggesting an old gas well. Samples were taken by the Walter Group (Scott Charmichael). Water is salty with benzene concentrations below the 5 ug/l standard value. Water was allowed to dilute with irrigation water until it was temporarily plugged by Jay Krabacher and the sub-contractor that has been working in P&A old wells in Debeque. Carlos Lujan called and talked to Jim and Judy Lake, the landowners and they expressed they were satisfied with the ""temporary"" solution and how fast COGCC handled the situation. They didn't believe anything else needed to be done at this time. Therefore, I am closing this complaint.

FYI - REGARDING THE BADGER TRUCKING COMPLAINT

They pumped out a manure sump for the Double J Packing Plant so there was no produced water dumped.  Im inclined to believe it was fresh water (has to be dumped before returning to facility on cold days so doesnt freeze) or at the worst tank rinse water residue but if it were, it must not have been real nasty or the complainant would have noticed an odor and he wouldnt have been convinced it was produced water.  I let Badger know nothing is allowed to be dumped on County roads for disposal.  Ill talked to Phil Wicke at Double J, he said the manure water was applied on Double J property as a fertilizer under Jeff Hasbroucks direction and if it was the manure pit material - you would know it!  Im going to document this as a complaint, not a spill, and close it out.

Subject: Statements from operators and job ticket

Troy  
Attached are the statements from our operators and a copy of the job ticket for the work performed in Weld County on January 21,2013.  As you can see by the job ticket and statements, we were not working in the oil filed on that day and the spill was fresh water from our fresh water tanks due to a valve that was not completely closed prior to leaving the job site.

Please call me to discuss further.

thanks

Initial Complaint Contact with Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission: phone conversation with Jane Stanczyk, referred to Craig Carlile for follow up field interview.
Complaint Interview Date: December 2, 2014, Conducted by Craig Carlile, Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission Field Inspector, Phone (970) 629-8279
Date of Incident: Saturday, November 29, 2014
Incident Description:
On November 29, 2014 the complainant observed a Dawson Geophysical seismic crew installing data sampling equipment (geophones) in a historically significant cemetery (Pleasant View Ridge Cemetery) across County Line Road to the East of her residence.  The complainant approached the crew inquiring about their presence and appropriateness of their work activity being within the fenced boundary of the cemetery.  Complainant reported that the crew responded that they were unaware that they were on cemetery property. 
A member of the work crew stated to the complainant that the work was being performed for Anadarko Petroleum and offered an Anadarko business card. Two members of the crew engaged in conversation with the complainant and neither was able to provide a business card. Complainant also reported that the crew was not able to provide a work permit.
Complainant reported that the crew left the cemetery by tilting a fence post and stepping over the associated wire fence on the north side of the cemetery property. This action may have damaged/broken the fence post at its base.  
The geophones and wire were present on the location at the time of the complainant interview.
Reference Information: 
Cemetery is located North of Oxford Road and East of County Line Road

COP continues to install large Thermal Combustors as made by QTI.  I could tell that at least one was in Operation at their Wellpad on Watkins Road just South of Jewell Ave - the 4-well operation there.  The Thermal Combustor was making the usual loud fan noise of these units, leading me to think they are in operation.
 
COGCC Rule 804 calls for these facilities to be painted a non-gloss color roughly matching surrounding terrain.  Yet, the Combustors are in their new shiny steel coat, which is a great eyesore, and in plain view fromf public roads such as Watkins Road and Jewell Ave., among others.   I would appreciate if you would perform a CO Complaint inspection of the COP 4-well pad on Watkins Road, and the two other Pads to the West of this one, and on Jewell Road.  All have the unpainted Thermal Combustors installed.  Their may be other pads with such non-conforming Paint issues that I have not yet seen.
 
And their Aurora, CO well pad (Cherry Creek Vista) that is Western most on Jewell Ave and near Sand Creek has just received a Walking Beam pump that is painted in Black, not earthtone.  This pad also has a non-compliant Thermal Combustor installed.   Note that following Rule 804 was a condition of Aurora's approval for the development of this wellpad in that city.  So the Operator is violating both the COGCC rule, as well as the City's conditional approval of their Development Application at that Aurora well pad.
 
Thank you for following up with CO inspections for these complaints.","Susan Sherman, field inspector, called Mr. Dougherty on 10/22/2014 to tell him that inspections were completed on 05-005-7189, 7191, 7192 and 7194 (Watkins pad), 05-005-7215 (Cottonwood Creek pad), and 05-005-7217, 7218 (Grimm Motorcross and Sunset pad) on 10/21/2014 as he requested. There are four silver combustors at the Watkin pad and one silver combustor at the Cottonwood Creek pad but they are temporary, in process equipment and will be there until the wells are put into production. She told him that the operator said that this should be until the end of 2014. There was no silver combustor at the Grimm Motorcross and Sunset pad. She asked for clarification on the location of the black walking beam as the most western pad on Jewell is curently the Cottonwood Creek pad and not the Cherry Creek Vista. The Cherry Creek Vista well is not drilled yet. The entire pump jack at Cottonwood Creek was tan/green. He said that it must be the Cottonwood Creek location that he was referring to.",10/24/2014,N,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our names are Elisa Santagata and Brian Mac Donald. We live right in front of High Sierra Water treatment facility.  This High Sierra water plant were writing to you about is the one on weld county road 40 and 39 in LaSalle. We are responding to the registered letter we have received on 1/21/2014 from integrated Petroleum Technologies. This is the first notification concerning this issue we have received. As we have said all along, (WE DONT WANT THIS PLANT TO GET ANY LARGER). When this plant was assembled originally it was done illegally. In that it was put to close to our property. We were promised by the county that the plant was not to going to get any Larger, but yet there is another tank battery that showed up within the plant, without any notification from the county. We were told by the plant managers we were never going to have to worry about the plant blowing up, and yet there was a fire and we were evacuated for over six hours. 
High sierras employees weren't locking the gate; from time to time we were finding trucks in the plant after hours. I was told by Jim Belt it was out of his control. Then I called and spoke to Dan Garcia. He said he would handle the situation. I was told they have to leave the gate open in case the plant blew up, so their employees could get out. I had to remind them that my house is under a thousand feet from the plant. Where am I supposed to go?  I had to explain to them their own regulations concerning the locking of gate, and trucks not parking outside the gate, before seven oclock am. And having trucks inside the plant after nine oclock pm.
 I went to the county and spoke to Kim Ogle I know he will remember our conversions.  We have had issues with trucks parking on C R 40 before 7: 00 am on many occasions.  As it is we already have to deal with more traffic going in there and the dust and the noise. Truck drivers using there Jake breaks all the way down in front of the house to the corner of C R 40. I called and talked to Dan Garcia to see if could help us out.  They know even use Jake brakes while driving in to the plant. I called Josh on January the 19th 2014 I asked him to talk to the water truck drivers asking him to speak with them about not using their horns. Not even ten minutes went by; we had a truck honking his horn all the way into the plant. I have been to county more than once in 2013.
We were getting very bad smells so we acquired an H2s sensor and it has detected H2s on more than three occasions. So I went to county on this issue I spoke to Phil Brewer, and Troy Swain, also Trevor Jirichek either in person or by phone and they sent a gentlemans named James Taloumis to come to the house. When he showed up he had no equipment to test for the smells. No follows up with us. Also when there are a lot of trucks in the plant, we can smell the exhaust from their trucks.

Mr. Kirby Wynn, Garfield County Liaison, also called to follow-up on Mr. Roles Complaint.  The visit lasted more 4 hours.  The location was Encanas J13W pad (Roles #13-7A), COGCC Location ID #334558.

Background:
Form 19 # 200070592 was submitted in 2005 by Encana to report the release of 400 bbls of unused frac water with high Sodium content.  A Work plan (REM # 6059) was submitted to remediate the site.  This Project was closed on 1/11/2013 based on Encanas remediation work and confirmation samples (No SAR issues).

On 01/31/2011, Linda Spry ORourke entered Complaint # 200310559, attending Mr. Roles allegations that Frac spill from several years ago had not been addressed satisfactorily. Gary H. at COGCC had been working on it before he transferred; no contact with Rick since.  This complaint was closed on 3/29/2013, after new round of samples were taken by Encana that demonstrated no issues with SAR.

This complaint # 200384978 is entered regarding the following allegations by Mr. Rick Roles:
1.	Mr. Roles complained that he had been asking for emission control in all wells (and tanks?) in the area and nothing has been done.
2.	Produced water spilled in 2005 was not remediated properly and vegetation in the affected area (North and East) is not growing as in the surroundings.
3.	He complained that he has not received the latest soil sampling analytical results.
4.	Mr. Roles showed me few rocks within the pad that he identified as Soli-bond.  According to him, Encana dumped Soli-bond on his property in and around the pad.

My responses to points above:
1.	General complaints about air quality and/or oil and gas emissions in the Valley have to be reported to the County Health Dept.; COGCC Inspection Unit (Shaun Kellerby; and/or CDPHE  Air Control Dept.  This information was given to him in writing.
2.	Although it is true that there is a difference between the vegetation in the area impacted in 2005 and the vegetation nearby, there is vegetation growing.  According to the confirmation sample results (2011), SAR values are significantly lowers than 12.  COGCC staff believes that there is not enough merit to request Encana to take action here.
3.	I gave him (in his hands) a copy of all the latest analytical reports on file at COGCC.  I gave him, specifically, a copy of the analytical results corresponding to the confirmation samples, taken in response to his 2011 complaint.
4.	I will contact Encana (Charles H. Jensen, EHS Environmental Group) to get his feedback on the Soli-bond issue.  Soli-Bond has been used in the past in Colorado to solidify impacted material (E&P waste) and immobilize chemicals of concern.  Spreading or burying solidified impacted material is not allowed per COGCC Rules.  Depending on the response, either an investigation will be required from Encana, or if satisfactory evidence is presented, no further action will be required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the proposed well will drill to depth of 14,500 feet BGS, the actual fracking may take place multiple places along the drill course.  This is a directional well, not a vertical bore, and Shell does not know what they will encounter. Shell has not committed to fracking in any identified area.  Therefore, the distance to nearby wells cannot be determined.  Also, there is a new agriculture structure (barn & stable) less than 2,000 feet from the proposed well. 
Baseline testing of well water should not be the nearest two wells to which they have access.  The nearest two wells may or may not be domestic wells, and if the water monitors do not have full and unconditional access then testing will not take place.  This must be amended to include testing within a radius of three to five miles.  This is crucial and not a negotiable item for reasons of ground water movement identified further in this response.","Regarding Water Protection and Testing:
The COGCC has no evidence that would support a requirement to test all wells within 3 to 5 miles of the Klikus 2-19 well.  Even in cases where this agency has documented cases of water well contamination, the contaminants have not migrated such a distance.  The requirement for the two nearest wells has been used throughout the state, and is appropriate, because the nearest wells are the most likely to show the first signs of impact if it were to occur.  Further, we do not specify the type of well that should be considered, because it may be equally appropriate to test a shallow alluvial aquifer as a deep drinking water aquifer.  Further, upon allegation of impact to a domestic water well, the COGCC will always investigate.  ",7/7/2011,Y,N,,N,,N,,5506307.0,05-055-06307,55.0,Huerfano,2-19,KLIKUS,90042.001-01,f,f,t,f,423520.0,423529.0,KLIKUS 2-19,AL,2013-10-31,78110.0,SWEPI LP,99999.0,WILDCAT,7189.06,-105.053578,37.514053000000004,495265.0,4151900.0,24.0,29S,69W,SENE,6,1566.0,N,328.0,E,PLANNED LatLong,f,f,f,t,f,f,f,f,,,,f,,f,http://cogcc.state.co.us/cogis/FacilityDetail.asp?facid=05506307&type=WELL,2017-02-24 11:00:00,2017-02-24 11:00:00,f

To my knowledge, no one has ever drilled to 14,500 in this basin.  There are over 1500 radial dikes that run through the formations.  To think that Shell will be able to maintain the fluids in the target area is a bit implausible.  Especially since we really dont know what the target formation is.  Again, Shell does not know what they will encounter, they are keeping their options open.  If they have to frack at 7,000 feet BGS, is that a target area?","Regarding the Unique Geology/Hydrology:
The operator in this case is able to rely on seismic studies conducted in close proximity to the location and on data from a 10,000 foot deep well recently drilled approximately 3 miles to the southwest.  Moreover, this is an exploratory well, so the operator will be constantly assessing information gathered during the drilling and completion of the well.

The map included with your comments indicates that landowners and easement holders may not have been notified by the operator.

The requirements for notifications and consultations are covered in Rules 305 and 306.

Regarding local soil instability, our review of the available data indicated that the thickness of the unstable soil was 60 inches and that such soil will not be used for road building.  The operators site plan which includes cut and fill information accounts for the removal of topsoil prior to pad construction; this upper soil horizon was also evaluated to be the least stable.  In our review of current and recent historic aerial photographs, we observed numerous pits and ponds proximate to this location that have been in use for  many years.

At a natural gas site recently, two welders were killed and the ensuing fire could not be extinguished for two days because the rural fire department did not have the kind of equipment needed to handle that type of fire.  We all take extraordinary precautions these days and I am sure no one will be negligent, however, accidents happen.  The services needed to handle potential fire hazards is simple not sufficient for this type of operation. ","Regarding Fire Hazard:
The COGCC understands the fear of fire risk, especially in light of current hot and dry conditions, however, flaring is a controlled event, engineered for safety.  The well pad itself also creates a buffer area free of combustible vegetation.  While many local and volunteer fire departments are not equipped to fight fires associated with production facilities, they do play a vital role in protecting public safety during such emergencies, primarily by preventing public access to a developing situation, providing information to the public, and coordinating resources to aid specialized oil field emergency response contractors who are trained and equipped to respond to catastrophic events and can mobilize to a location within hours.  ",7/8/2011,Y,N,,N,,N,,5506307.0,05-055-06307,55.0,Huerfano,2-19,KLIKUS,90042.001-01,f,f,t,f,423520.0,423529.0,KLIKUS 2-19,AL,2013-10-31,78110.0,SWEPI LP,99999.0,WILDCAT,7189.06,-105.053578,37.514053000000004,495265.0,4151900.0,24.0,29S,69W,SENE,6,1566.0,N,328.0,E,PLANNED LatLong,f,f,f,t,f,f,f,f,,,,f,,f,http://cogcc.state.co.us/cogis/FacilityDetail.asp?facid=05506307&type=WELL,2017-02-24 11:00:00,2017-02-24 11:00:00,f

In regard to the referenced commission order against Petroglyph Energy, it was suspected but not proven that dikes contributed to the groundwater impacts. The related investigations are posted in the Library on our website under Raton Basin. The geological situation at that location is substantially different from the Freeman 3-24 location. In addition there are many examples of CBM wells in Raton Basin that logged igneous intrusions and no problems have occurred. At present COGCC has no substantial reason to prevent SWEPI from drilling in the proposed direction. SWEPI does not plan to frac the well initially, however they have the right to do so. We explained the Sundry was not posted on the public site due to a document management mechanism within the COGCC database to keep from releasing confidential information.",12/13/2012,N,N,,N,,N,,5506309.0,05-055-06309,55.0,Huerfano,3-24,Freeman,,f,t,f,t,429619.0,429618.0,Freeman 3-24,PR,2016-06-01,10630.0,ALTA MESA SERVICES LP,99999.0,WILDCAT,7076.71,-105.067631,37.684828,494037.0,4170850.0,24.0,27S,69W,NWSW,6,2105.0,S,536.0,W,ACTUAL LatLong,f,f,f,t,f,f,t,t,2013-08-14,2013-08-16,2013-10-14,f,59.0,f,http://cogcc.state.co.us/cogis/FacilityDetail.asp?facid=05506309&type=WELL,2017-02-24 11:00:00,2017-02-24 11:00:00,f

At approximately 1:00 p.m. on Tuesday, September 04, 2012 I was traveling on USFS Road 844A which leads through and past the Ragged Mountain Compressor Station.  Dusty Carson of SG and Steve Tuck were in the vehicle with me.  We did not stop the vehicle as we drove past the Ragged Mountain Compressor.
2.	As we drove past the station, I noticed the grass on both sides of the road on the southwest edge of the Station.  The grass on the west edge of the road above the inlet to a culvert was yellow and orange in color.  The grass on the east edge of the road at and below the outlet of the same culvert was this same yellow and orange color.  The grass appeared to be colored from a chemical burn or reaction.  The grass surrounding the ditch and the outlet of the culvert was not discolored, but rather was green and brown as would be expected in the area.
3.	At the same time I witnessed the discolored grass, I saw a pile of ž minus rock in a pile on the west side of the road northeast of the horizontal propane tank.  This rock had not been present when I had been on location on 8-29-12.  While on location with other SG personnel, Al Arsenault and Phil Nichol of Gunnison Energy Corporation has indicated/admitted there had been a release of amine from the Station.  A dark stain across the road and residue on the grass above and below the culvert were visible on 8-29.
4.	Later on 9-4-12, at approximately 3:00 p.m., I returned to the Ragged Mtn. Compressor Station with Dusty Carson.  As I approached the Station, I witnessed a skid steer operating on and near the road.  I pulled through the Station and parked my vehicle on the road.  I exited my vehicle and the individual operating the skid steer suspended his operation, exited his vehicle and approached. 
5.	The individual, Dan Hudson of Hudson Excavation, introduced himself and asked if he could help me.
6.	I introduced myself to Hudson, informing him that I worked for SG Interests and we were half owners of the Station.  I asked Hudson what he was doing.  Hudson stated that he was building some berms and fixing ditches around the Station.  Hudson asked if there was a problem.  I told him that I knew there had been a release/spill the previous week.   I asked why he was covering up the area where the release had occurred.  He did not give a direct answer other than that he had been instructed by GEC to conduct the work.  I told him that I believed what he was doing was against regulation and perhaps illegal.  
7.	Hudson acknowledged that he was covering up the discolored grass.  
8.	Hudson indicated that he had uncovered an electric ground wire.  In response, I asked if he or GEC had conducted a One-Call.  Hudson indicated that a One-Call had not been made since GEC owned the Station.  
9.	I told Hudson that I was going to take a few photos for my records.  I then told Hudson we were going to drive up the road and would return in a few minutes.  Hudson indicated we wanted to give me a business",Issues regarding this complaint have been addressed.  See Document 2230703.

The water sample did not contain concentrations of BTEX or TPH above the method detection limits.  In addition, the water sample did not contain detectable concentrations of methane.  

The odor associated with the water that was described in the complaint may be related to the SRB in the well.  The black particles may indicate scaling associated with sulfate and other minerals detected in the water.  Proper treatment of the well to remove the bacteria may help to improve the overall quality of the water.

This T-intersection is also the entrance to the North Fork Ranch.

As I was approaching the intersection, I observed a tanker-type semi-truck stopped on the asphalt.  I observed a single male walk from the back of the vehicle to the driver door, enter the semi and start moving toward me.  As we passed each other on the roadway (the semi heading East, I heading West), i observed a large fan-shaped discharge of water-like substance spraying from the back of the vehicle.  At the same time I also smelled a strong oil/hydrocarbon odor.  I stopped my vehicle near the T-intersection and stepped out.  The odor was stronger at this time, and I observed a sirty-water like substance on the roadway.  I liiked East toward the semi-travelling away from my location and observed the water-like spray continuing to come from the back of the vehicle until the vehicledrove out of site over a samll rise approximately 1/4 mile away.

Good morning Chris;
Attached are several photos I photographed this afternoon. ( Feb 6, 2012) The camera is
facing south on County Rd #335, directly south of Silt, CO. I do not recall these ice (water)
flows being here previously in past years. By the discoloration, this is not fresh ground
water. This shows a huge amount of water flow, coming from several areas, however with
this being the Winter season, any ground water levels would be much lower than would be
shown here. Also one would believe this was a constant flow to achieve such high level of
ice. This can not be from run-off as the ridge is not that high, and the height of the ice, as
shown in the last 2 photos.
I would have to ask, is it possible this is water from drilling or fracking from over the hill
on County Rd #335? Antero does have permits staked nearby. The coloration does suggest
Production Water that Antero uses very often.
Would reply as soon as you have a conclusion?","I chipped off a chunk of ice from the toe of the ice flow, which was slowly melted and bottled for the laboratory sample.  I was not able to 'trim' the chuck well, and so some of the surface ice flow was included in the sample.  Because the surface of the ice flow toe was adjacent to the roadway, it had received some splatter from of the roadway during wet weather.

The analytical results (attached) report a very low concentration of diesel range organics, which I interpret to be from the roadway splash.  The level is very low, and if the seep/flow were from produced water, I would expect a much higher concentration of hydrocarbon constituents.  I would have also expected potassium and chloride concentrations to be several orders of magnitude higher than what was reported in the sample if the ice was from the freezing of produced water.  The total dissolved solids are within the range I typically see from shallow groundwater aquifers in this area.  Produced water typically has total dissolved solids at concentrations an order of magnitude higher than this as well.

So, to conclude, I did not see any analytical evidence to indicate that the ice flow was the result of released produced water migrating through the subsurface.  The flow appears to be from a natural seep of shallow groundwater.",10/12/2012,N,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The location is the Strear V03-73HN (API 05-123-33567) located in the SESE of Section 3, Township 2 North, Range 67 West. The site is just north of WCR 24 within about 1.5 miles to the east of the main Fredrick City limits.    Noble is in the final process of completing the well and crews performing the flow-back had parked a trailer adjacent to the flare line.  The flowback experienced a slug of condensate that extinguished the flare and discharged some of the fluid onto the adjacent trailer tire(s) which caught fire and was responsible for the black smoke observed at the location.  The fire was promptly extinguished and, as best Curtis knew, did not involve any City of County emergency response,  but was handled at the site by the site personnel.  No injuries and minor equipment damage (trailer tire(s)).

He stated that this has gone on for months, it occurs 24 hours a day and most occurs within the same 50 yard stretch.  He is concerned that waste will drain to waterway.","I, Soraya Baroumand, and Bill West, District 45 Water Commissioner, met with Alina Vazquez of the EPA Criminal Investigation Division, at the locations previously reported as areas of alleged illegal dumping along an irrigation ditch; namely, a large dirt parking area adjacent south of the I-70/Garfield County Airport eastbound exit ramp, and at turnout areas on the frontage road, west of Mamm Creek Road alongside theLast Chance Ditch. 
  
During our field visit of March 6, 2012, diversion of irrigation water via pumping and hauling was observed, (as I previously observed and January and February 2012). Screens and hoses appeared clean and no leaks from the bobtail trucks and associated equipment were observed.  Furthermore, bobtail units observed were designated for freshwater hauling only.  Also, no surficial staining or discharge at the ditch access turnouts was observed.  
The surface water diversion is known as the Alternate Points of Diversion for the Last Chance Ditch per court decree 05CW52 of the District Court in Water Division 5. 
The Last Chance Ditch is administered by the district 45 Water Commissioner year round.  

Further information regarding these points of diversions, pumping sites, or other water right matters can be obtained by contacting Bill West, District 45 Water Commissioner at 970 930-5365 or via email: william.west@state.co.us

Here are some pictures of the blow out damage, of the well on T6N R90W sec. 16. On this section I own the surface, The State of Colorado owns the Oil and Gas, and HRM is the operating company.   This has been like this for several years and has not showed any signs of recovery.   It is alarming to think of what has leached into the ground over this period of time. This well is suronded by alfalfa production.  540 acres of this section is producing alfalfa hay for the cattle we raise.  There is also several wells and springs near by.    I have contacted the current operating company, and so far have got very little response.  They blame it on the previous owners of The Buck Peak Feild.  

The operating company HRM, wants to drill 3 more wells in this section, in which the state owns the minerals.  They have premits pending, currently.  I feel that they should fix the problems first before going any further.  
 
The offer from HRM has been very small in regaurds to a ""surface use agreement"".  They have stated that they don't really need one.  I have spent several thousand dollars on attorney fees so far and have achieved very little.  
 
This feild has some of the best producing wells in the state of Colorado.  I feel that they should make it right for all the people involved.  The operating company, the state, and the surface owner, should all be treated well.  This feild has the potential to recover the costs of production very rapidly.  I feel that they should offer an over ride royalty interest to the surface owner.  
 
Any encouragement you could give to HRM to make things right with the surface owner would be greatly appreciated. 
 
I will send some more pictures and update you on any developments.  If you need the contact information for HRM let me know.
 
 
Thank You

Subject: Black Hills 35-2 compliance questions for you

Linda, hi. I have a compliance question to discuss with you.

I told Black Hills to contact COGCC regarding some reserve pit contents
they turned up while digging a new fluids pit in supposedly virgin ground,
on an existing pad, on private land (split estate). They are preparing to
re-complete a federal well there and need a frac fluids pit.

The stuff they turned up was black and stinky, so I told them to segregate
it on a liner and cover it, then contact you to mitigate it appropriately,
which would include sampling it to your standards. I've told them twice
(which counts as orders from BLM, in the category of Verbal Warning) but
now they're telling me they've sampled it to COGCC standards and concluded
on their own that there's no need to contact COGCC. I told them to document
all their sampling to me, I thought they probably should fill out forms
with you, etc, etc. Am I right? Is this 'pit closure'? Something else? They
were actually removing soil to build a new pit, but will be putting it back
when the pit is closed.

They didn't notify me when they turned up the contaminated soil (which also
contained pieces of old pit liner), although they were aware of it. Until I
discovered it during a construction inspection, they were just burying it
with the rest of the subsoil coming out of the ground.

API is 050770940300S1

What do you think about how to pursue this? I'll paste in my inspection
notes below.

PS - just as a sidenote, the pad expansion was not constructed to BLM or
CDPHE standards, and they're under orders to fix that immediately as well.
Fill slopes loose/unstable and steep, insufficient SW BMPs, etc.

COGCC staff told Mrs. Myers her request would be entered as a complaint and an alert would be placed on the MapGuide to notify permitting staff to let COGCC environmental staff know if there are pending permits in the vicinity of the Myers well, and COGCC would collect samples when development activity is in reasonable proximity to the Myers water well. Mr.s Myers was very insistent that we collect samples soon. COGCC staff explained that samples have been collected from the Dawson aquifer between the Myers well and the proposed Renegade well and that impacts would be manifested at those locations well before they would be observed at the Myers well. Staff also described that groundwater moves slowly and for any impacts to reach the Myers water well would take many, many years and likely not occur in any case as well as the fact that a baseline sample closer to the start of O&G development activities would be more valuable than one collected possibly years in advance of drilling. Staff noted that the decision was not arbitrary, was not based upon manpower or budget concerns, but was in staff's opinion a sound, reasonable decision based upon an understanding of hydrogeology and that COGCC would collect samples when there is a reasonable chance of an impact from oil and gas exploration and production activities.",5/28/2015,N,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would like to take this opportunity to share with you some of the frustration I am having with Encana. Recently Encana approached me with the desire to run a temporary water line down my property. I met with their land man and we negotiated a deal and came to and agreement in the form of a contract. The team assigned to the task was very interested in the improvement of the image that Encana has locally. We started out working together and I actually thought at that point that they were doing a good job in improving public relations. As they were completing some of the work that was associated with our agreement I met them and we discussed making a few modifications to the work that they had in place to which they agreed. A few day later I reviewed the work that they had done and frankly, they had made a mess of it. I reached out to them and was basically told too bad  nothing we can do at this time. I had also requested that the lighting that they had installed for the frac operations was pointing at my home and as such could  they please realign them to point at the pad. I was informed that they did the best they could. I will attach some photos. I can also forward you the emails I sent to David Grisso at Encana regarding these issues if you like.  No realignment has taken place nor have any of the issues been addressed. You will note in the photos that the lights are clearly aligned right at my home, not at the pad where the work is taking place. The light pool of the night time shots will indicate that the lights only illuminate one small corner of the frac tanks and is pointing right at me on my deck. 
It had been my hope that the new Encana was going to step up and do the right thing. However, I have gotten very little response in terms of the issues and nothing has been done regarding the fugitive light. Thus, I am writing to you to see if you can help me to resolve these issues as the governing body of the gas industry. 
The major issues are as follows:
	One of the light plants at the pad is clearly pointing directly at my house which is approx. 1200 feet in elevation above the pad (photos attached)
	At no time during the negotiations for the temporary water line was I informed that there would be someone stationed on my property 24/7 during the frac operations
	The finishing touches on the work agreed to by Encana still needs to be completed
	The lack of response to my concerns and issues indicates to me that there is no desire to address the issues
	Noise is also an issue which I had not yet addressed with Encana. I am not sure what the standard for db levels at an industrial site is but typically these would be measured at the property line which is right next to the pad. If you could let me know what levels are acceptable I  will get a db meter and see where they are  because I am certain that they do not meet the residential requirements even a half mile away.

Subject: Report of Gas Well Venting 

Kent,

I received a phone call today from a frustrated gas well owner.  Her name is Katherine and her phone number is 970-487-3143.  She indicated that Encana operates the Atkins 26-4 well on her property and that the well was venting gas significantly last night.  Ultimately, her neighbor was able to shut in the venting at around 9pm last night.  Katherines lawyer recommended that she call and report the incident.  Based on information she shared with me, Encana has not responded to her request to evaluate and resolve the problem.  

I am not certain if this would be something for you or the COGCC to follow up on.  However, if you believe it is, please do so.  

Thank you,

Hi Doris,

I received a complaint from a landowner who reported to me that he has been trying to reach someone at Maralex to get a fencing issue around a well pad resolved.  

I would like to schedule a joint visit to this location with Maralex personnel.  Who at your company should I work with to schedule this field visit?

Thanks for letting me know.

Re:  Complaint of thermogenic gas expressing into West Divide Creek

Dear Mrs. ORourk,

I am writing to inform the COGCC and other interested parties with jurisdiction in this matter, of the recently discovered presence of what appears to be thermogenic gas in West Divide Creek.

Results from a soil/gas survey conducted on September 03, 2010 by Vista Geo-Science and EnCana Oil and Gas USA reveal the presence of heavier hydrocarbons together with a higher concentration of methane. These heavier hydrocarbons include ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes. Whereas EnCana has characterized this gas as biogenic, a July 2008 letter from Mr. Chesson of the COGCC stated:

>>Begin letter<<
""As you know since 2004, the COGCC staff has responded to your concerns about potential gas seepage along West Divide Creek on your property and to date we have not found any indication that the seepage you have observed is related to oil and gas activity.  Last year both EnCana and COGCC investigated a similar allegation and samples were collected in November and December 2007.  In 2004, I personally collected gas samples from your beaver ponds and at other locations of concern to you.  Since 2004, samples have been collected at 9 different locations.  These samples have been collected by COGCC staff and 3rd party consultants on behalf of EnCana.  These samples have been analyzed for a variety of parameters including natural gas compounds (methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexanes), heavier hydrocarbon compounds including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEX), stable isotopes of methane, bacteria (iron related, sulfate reducing, and slime), major anions and cations, and other field and laboratory tests.  To date, BTEX compounds have not been detected in any of the samples.  Although methane has been detected, stable isotope analysis indicates that it is biogenic not thermogenic and the heavier natural gas compounds (propane, butane, pentane, hexanes) that are part of the gas produced by the wells in your area have not been detected.  Some of the samples have been tested using biological activity and reaction test (BART) techniques.  BART analyses detect the presence of iron related, sulfate reducing, and slime bacteria.  Large quantities of these bacteria were detected in the samples tested.  These naturally occurring nuisance bacteria produce iridescent sheens on stagnant water, iron hydroxide (orange/rust colored) stained slime, black slime, and red, orange, and/or black particles.  In 2004, during my inspections along West Divide Creek I observed this kind of biological activity at numerous locations and I believe that I pointed out occurrences to you at a couple of locations on your property.

As a residential community, this is the eyesore that neighbors have tolerated during since last Summer: a number of acres of nothing but blowing sand and dust.  Any nutrients that may have existed in the soil disturbed by Anadarko's crews has long since been re-deposited on land miles away because it was never properly reclaimed when drilling ceased and equipment was removed.
 
It has been our experience that Anadarko is alone in this kind of practice....we never have to worry about Encana or Noble not being good stewards of the environment.
 
We'll leave it up to you folks to decide whether this type of behavior is:
 
   a) part of the corporate culture at this company,
 
   b) disrespectful of the surface owner,

Concerned about the Pawnee 2-16-1 (API 123-31432) located approx 0.4-miles west.,"COGCC concludes that the original report of elevated As, Cd, Pb and Se in the post-fracture sample collected on April 13, 2011, was incorrect based on the following factors:

	The re-analysis of the post-fracture water sample collected on April 13, 2011, did not contain detectable concentrations of dissolved As, Cd, Pb or Se;
	The second post-fracture sample collected on April 28, 2011, for analysis of total and dissolved metals, as analyzed by both Test America and Accutest, did not contain detectable concentrations of the four metals;
	Results for the other nine metals analyzed for total and dissolved concentrations were consistent between sampling events.

When the results of the baseline sample and the post-fracture sample are compared, concentrations of the other water quality parameters were consistent and did not indicate any significant change in the water quality between the sampling events.  Finally, there was no indication during the fracture stimulation operations that any spills, releases, or other problems had occurred that would lead to contamination of the Fox-Hills Aquifer in the vicinity of your residence.

Based on these conclusions, COGCC finds that there has been no impact to groundwater quality in the vicinity of your residence related to oil & gas operations at the Pawnee 2-16-1.  As a result your complaint (COGCC #200300876) is closed with this letter.

Odors were described as sewer odor until 2007 at which time it went away.  In 2008 a new odor was described as gas smell.  Complainant believes that the changes in odor correspond with drilling of nearby gas well.  A radon mitigation system was recently installed over sump in basement and odor has subsided.  Complainant is still concerned that gas could be getting into basement and is now being vented outside towards neighbors houses.  Several other houses in development have had similar problems.,No indication of natural gas in exhaust of mitigation system from complainants basement.

He is Rob Regulski (970-876-2675).  He owns land at the frontage road and Divide Creek Road and Antero has an easement for a pipeline across his property, along the road.  His concern that involves OGLA folks is that the pipeline leads to a wellpad (McLin A) which is adjacent and uphill from his property.  He was notified by Antero, via letter, that per Rule 305, he may submit comments concerning the permit application.  He is not certain how to do this.  Mr. Regulski  states that there is an unmapped ditch (Ward-Reynolds Ditch) that Mr. Regulski  is majority owner of that goes along hillside between the proposed pad and his property.  He believes that the ditch and Anteros pipeline are in jeopardy, and would certainly be impacted by anything flowing downhill.  The entire area is in 315B buffer zones, it appears to be partially in intermediate buffer, definitely outer buffer zone.  Rob provided a copy of the 2A, which has current land use marked as Rangeland; Rob states there are historic water rights to the property and it should be marked as irrigated for both current and future use.

Complainant also believes that the water is causing skin irritation.,"TDS and pH exceeded the CDPHE secondary drinking water standard.  The result for sulfate was the same as the CDPHE standard.  None of the other analyzed constituents exceeded the CDPHE primary or secondary drinking water standards.  The water sample did not contain the organic compounds benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene or xylenes, which are often associated with contamination from petroleum hydrocarbons.  The water sample contained a trace of methane less than the theoretical threshold level of 1.1 mg/L that could result in accumulation of methane in confined, unventilated spaces and potentially be explosive.  The overall quality of the water is similar to water produced from other water wells in Weld County, Colorado.

The investigation was inconclusive regarding the original source, but did determine that there is no ongoing source and the methane is naturally attenuating.  In addition, no other contaminants such as BTEX were ever detected in the groundwater.  The methane impact was not associated with hydraulic fracturing.  Although the source was not identified, Kerr McGee voluntarily provided a temporary potable water system to the Conklin residence in 2010 and ultimately a domestic water tap was provided as a permanent solution.  All surrounding water wells within 1/2-mile were sampled and verified no additional impacts in the area.  Kerr-McGee continues to perform monitoring of nearby water wells in the vicinity.

Just south of our home is a drilling rig set up by Ensign, just East of our library on a lot within a few hundred feet of our residential area. The rig is extremely noisy, and my guess in the 70-90 Db range. The noise levels are at their highest after dark, when the work seems to increase. It is noisy at all times, but as I write this on Sunday night at 9PM, it is very, very loud, and I am the second row of homes in.

I am a trained sound technician, and know sound levels. This is extreme and beyond normal noise levels, not to mention the bright lights they have trained directly at our homes.

The rig has been on site for over two weeks, running 24 hours/ day, with increased levels of activity and noise at night. It has the entire neighborhood on edge, with some folks even leaving their homes to get sleep and peace and quiet.

There has been absolutely no attempt by Ensign to contain the noise or lights. Trucks come and go at all times of day and especially night, with their loud beeping tones waking us up at all hours. The rig itself is extremely noisy and no sound barriers have been set up. Sleeping through the night has become immpossible, much less a quiet nieghborhood to enjoy.

The water sample did not contain the organic compounds benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene or xylenes, which are often associated with contamination from petroleum hydrocarbons.  The water sample did not contain detectable concentrations of dissolved methane.

This is another formal written complaint about the noise from Rubicon Oil.  The noise is once again above the levels for agricultural areas and is once again loud enough to affect our sleep--even with ear plugs, foam, and a white noise machine.  This is also another complaint against COGCC for not complying with the rules you are to follow enforcing noise limits!  And once again, if the industrial limits ""supersede"" the paragraphs that come after it--why include those paragraphs and the noise limits at all.  Why not just state that they can operate at whatever noise level they want?  COGCC is playing games and does not have anyone's interests in mind but the industry's!

Rubicon was suppose to be gone a week ago and they are STILL here!  They always decide to wait until we go to bed to crank up all their engines!

This is another formal written complaint about the noise from Rubicon Oil.  The noise is once again above the levels for agricultural areas and is once again loud enough to affect our sleep--even with ear plugs, foam, and a white noise machine.  This is also another complaint against COGCC for not complying with the rules you are to follow enforcing noise limits!  And once again, if the industrial limits ""supersede"" the paragraphs that come after it--why include those paragraphs and the noise limits at all.  Why not just state that they can operate at whatever noise level they want?  COGCC is playing games and does not have anyone's interests in mind but the industry's!

Rubicon was suppose to be gone a week ago and they are STILL here!  They always decide to wait until we go to bed to crank up all their engines!

He stated that no interim reclamation has taken place and that the location was not adequately designed and constructed with respect to surface disturbance minimization and unnecessary alteration of natural features, of which steep vertical cuts have resulted in cumulative impacts.","COGCC inspected the Dixon B Federal well pad on June 6, 2010, and also July 27, 2010 and are documented in field inspection report #s 200263751 and 200265070 in the COGCC database.  A letter detailing the field observations and requirements has been sent to the complainant and Antero Resources, and is summarized below:   

Presently, there is no violation of Rule 1003.b, due to the following:   There are current (un-expired) APDs at this location, hence, the statutory time frame for commencing interim reclamation (Rule 1003.b.) of areas no longer in use, or reasonably needed to sustain operations, have not elapsed. Also, re-vegetation in progress was observed along the fill slope and near the location entrance.   However, it was observed that the cut slope requires BMPs for erosion control, and that the lease road and associated BMPs require periodic inspections and maintenance, per Rule 1002.f. 

Antero has been notified to correct the issues via telephone, email, and letter correspondence. COGCC will continue to inspect this location to ascertain effectiveness of BMPs.  ",8/27/2010,Y,N,,N,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wed 05/19/2010 6:00 AMDear  Burkhardt:

I have copied the COGCC rules concerning the process a complainant would follow if they are dissatisfied with the complaint resolution by staff and also the noise rules that staff follow when investigation an noise issue.  Please submit the application, as discussed in Rule 522.a.(4) to Rob Willis, the COGCC Enforcement officer, and he can get the matter scheduled to be heard before the commission.  Again the COGCC is sorry that a better resolution could not be found in time to reduce the stress on you, your family and livestock.  If this process does not appear to be what you intended you can also submit a letter or email to the Director with the complaint against staff discussing the issues and problems you encountered.  The Director of the COGCC is David Neslin (david.neslin@state.co.us).  

 I spoke with Mike Bader with Rubicon yesterday evening and he indicated that they would be logging last night and that hay bales would be delivered this morning.  Hopefully the logging operations did not create as many noise issues as previous operations.  I will also contact Mr. McRobbie, the landman agent, for Rubicon this morning to make sure the hay bales are being delivered and set.  

I will be out of the office the next several days but if you need to contact me try me on my cell phone at (303) 548-6298 and I will be picking up emails during the evenings.

One wellhead exists on location and has been temporarily abandoned since July of 2008 (Document #1808248).  In addition, the field inspection confirmed the existence of two additional oil and gas construction areas within a 1/4 mile northeast of the above-referenced location and consists of the following:  A compacted and graded pad that has abandoned drilling equipment and associated materials, and to the north, the excavation site which appears to have been utilized as the earthen infill material for the construction of the Biscuit Ranch 10-31D pad.

Lisa lives between these two land owners and has had impacts previously on her property.  On 4/23/2010 Lisa took EPA, Garfield County and COGCC representatives on a driving tour from Dry Hollow Road and 6500 Road intersection to the eastern edge of West Divide Creek on her property. Lisa reported that several water wells in the area were ruined when the Arbane kick occurred on the P3 pad on March 9, 2004 (referred to below as the Arbaney event) and that multiple stock ponds had bubbles coming up in them. Lisa thinks the Arbaney event possibly exasperated or increased the fracture network subsurface as residents felt an the earth moving when that event occurred.  Lisa reports that the ridgeline between the Sherowski's property and the Thompson's property dropped in elevation as a result of the Arbaney event. Lisa reports that the water well and surface water impacts follow basically a linear path from P3 to the West Divide creek seep area from 2004 and 2008. Lisa expressed frustration that all timelines shes seen begin in April 2004 and go forward, and do not include this significant kick at the Arbaney well which occurred on March 9, 2004.  Lisa feels that COGCC always compartmentalizes, minimizes, and isolates events from each other, rather than looking at the big picture.

Rick reported that PDC had a spill/release today at approximately 8am.  Rick reported that liquid was discharging from a 4 pipe at the base of a Rain for Rent storage tank (big, square tank) for about 20 minutes.  Rick estimated that more than 20 gallons were released.  Rick reported that it puddled in the road and ran down the road, but he said it did not make it all the way to the creek.  Rick collected a sample of the liquid, however it is unknown if it was from the discharge or from one of the puddles in the road.  The sample was collected in an 8-oz Kerr jelly jar, which Rick said was clean from the kitchen of his house.  The jar contained about 7 oz of liquid with lid and ring in place.  Jay Krabacher smelled the liquid in the jar and said it had a hydrocarbon and shoe-polish type odor to it.  Rick reported that Tony Barrientos, PDC Completion Supervisor Western Rockies told him that the liquid was fresh water from the creek, which Rick does not believe.  Rick reported that the release was shut down after about 20 minutes of discharge and PDC built berms to contain the spill.  Rick had Anthonys business card.  Rick does not seem to believe PDC will sample and report honestly.  Rick stated that ""Tony lied to him about the contents of the tank"".  Rick took his sample with him, stating it was insurance and was going to put it in his cooler to keep it cool.
